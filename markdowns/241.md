## **Understanding Partitioning with Collectors in Java 8 Streams API**

Java 8's **Streams API** has revolutionized data processing in Java by enabling functional programming with collections. One of its powerful features is **partitioning**, a specialized form of grouping that divides elements into two distinct groups based on a predicate. This is made possible by the `partitioningBy` method in the `Collectors` utility class.

This blog explores partitioning in detail, including its syntax, use cases, and examples to help you understand and apply it effectively.

### What is Partitioning?

**Partitioning** is a method to divide a stream's elements into two groups based on a predicate. The result is a `Map` with `Boolean` keys:
- `true` for elements that satisfy the predicate.
- `false` for elements that do not satisfy the predicate.

This is particularly useful for binary classifications, such as separating even and odd numbers, adults and minors, or passed and failed students.

### Syntax
```java
Collector<T, ?, Map<Boolean, List<T>>> partitioningBy(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
```
#### Variations:
1. **Simple Partitioning**: Partitions elements into two groups based on the predicate.
2. **Partitioning with Downstream Collector**: Applies additional processing to each group.

### Examples of Partitioning

#### Example Dataset
Weâ€™ll use the following `Employee` class and dataset for our examples:

```java
class Employee {
    String name;
    int age;
    double salary;

    Employee(String name, int age, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " (Age: " + age + ", Salary: " + salary + ")";
    }
}

List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
    new Employee("Alice", 25, 50000),
    new Employee("Bob", 35, 75000),
    new Employee("Charlie", 30, 60000),
    new Employee("David", 40, 80000),
    new Employee("Eve", 28, 70000)
);
```

#### 1. Simple Partitioning
Partition employees into two groups: younger than 30 and 30 or older.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class PartitioningExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Boolean, List<Employee>> partitionedByAge = employees.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(emp -> emp.age < 30));

        System.out.println("Employees younger than 30:");
        partitionedByAge.get(true).forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("Employees 30 or older:");
        partitionedByAge.get(false).forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Employees younger than 30:
Alice (Age: 25, Salary: 50000.0)
Eve (Age: 28, Salary: 70000.0)

Employees 30 or older:
Bob (Age: 35, Salary: 75000.0)
Charlie (Age: 30, Salary: 60000.0)
David (Age: 40, Salary: 80000.0)
```

#### 2. Partitioning with Downstream Collector
Find the total salary for employees in each age group.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class PartitioningWithDownstream {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Boolean, Double> totalSalaryByAgeGroup = employees.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(
                emp -> emp.age < 30,
                Collectors.summingDouble(emp -> emp.salary)
            ));

        System.out.println("Total salary of employees younger than 30: " + totalSalaryByAgeGroup.get(true));
        System.out.println("Total salary of employees 30 or older: " + totalSalaryByAgeGroup.get(false));
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Total salary of employees younger than 30: 120000.0
Total salary of employees 30 or older: 215000.0
```

#### 3. Multi-Level Partitioning
Partition employees by age and further group them by salary ranges.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class MultiLevelPartitioning {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Boolean, Map<String, List<Employee>>> partitionedByAgeAndSalary = employees.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(
                emp -> emp.age < 30,
                Collectors.groupingBy(emp -> emp.salary > 60000 ? "High Salary" : "Low Salary")
            ));

        System.out.println(partitionedByAgeAndSalary);
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
{true={High Salary=[Eve (Age: 28, Salary: 70000.0)], Low Salary=[Alice (Age: 25, Salary: 50000.0)]},
 false={High Salary=[Bob (Age: 35, Salary: 75000.0), David (Age: 40, Salary: 80000.0)], Low Salary=[Charlie (Age: 30, Salary: 60000.0)]}}
```

#### 4. Counting Elements in Each Partition
Count the number of employees in each partition.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class PartitioningCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Boolean, Long> countByAgeGroup = employees.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(
                emp -> emp.age < 30,
                Collectors.counting()
            ));

        System.out.println("Employees younger than 30: " + countByAgeGroup.get(true));
        System.out.println("Employees 30 or older: " + countByAgeGroup.get(false));
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Employees younger than 30: 2
Employees 30 or older: 3
```

### Performance Considerations
1. **Efficiency**: Partitioning is optimized for binary classification and is faster than general grouping for two categories.
2. **Parallel Streams**: Partitioning works seamlessly with parallel streams for large datasets.
3. **Memory Usage**: Partitioning creates two groups; ensure sufficient memory for large streams.

---

### Best Practices
1. Use `partitioningBy` for binary classifications, such as true/false, pass/fail, or above/below threshold.
2. Combine partitioning with downstream collectors for more complex use cases, such as counting, summing, or multi-level grouping.
3. Leverage parallel streams for performance benefits with large datasets.

### Conclusion
The `partitioningBy` collector in Java 8 Streams API provides a powerful and efficient way to divide elements into two groups based on a predicate. Its flexibility, especially when combined with downstream collectors, makes it an indispensable tool for stream-based data processing.
