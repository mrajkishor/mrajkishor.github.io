## 🚀 Introduction

In Artificial Intelligence (AI), **search algorithms** are fundamental for problem-solving agents. **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)** is a powerful uninformed search strategy that combines the benefits of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** — achieving both **optimality** and **space efficiency**.

---

## ❓ Why IDS?

* **BFS** is complete and optimal but has high space complexity: O(b^d)
* **DFS** is space efficient: O(bm) but incomplete and non-optimal
* ✅ IDS bridges the gap by running DFS **repeatedly with increasing depth limits**

---

## 🧠 How IDS Works

1. Start with a depth limit = 0 (level = 0)
2. Run DFS up to that limit (or up to that level)
3. If no solution found, increment the limit (or, level = level + 1)
4. Apply DFS again to the new limit (or, level).
5. Repeat until goal is found

This effectively simulates BFS but only using DFS under-the-hood.

## 🔁 IDS Example

Imagine a tree with branching factor `b = 2` and depth `d = 3`:

```
           A
         /   \
        B     C
       / \   / \
      D   E F   G
```

IDS would execute:

* **Depth 0**: A
* **Depth 1**: A → B, C
* **Depth 2**: A → B → D, E; A → C → F, G
* ...

Each iteration restarts DFS from scratch, but this repeated effort is minor due to the geometric growth of nodes per depth.

## 🧮 Time and Space Complexity

| Metric       | Value             |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| **Time**     | O(b^d)            |
| **Space**    | O(bd)             |
| **Complete** | ✅ Yes             |
| **Optimal**  | ✅ Yes (unit cost) |

Even though earlier levels are re-visited, the total number of redundant expansions is small compared to the total nodes at the bottom-most level.

## 📦 Pseudocode

```python
function IDS(root, goal):
    depth = 0
    while True:
        result = DLS(root, goal, depth)
        if result != null:
            return result
        depth += 1

function DLS(node, goal, limit):
    if node == goal:
        return node
    if limit == 0:
        return null
    for child in node.children:
        result = DLS(child, goal, limit - 1)
        if result != null:
            return result
    return null
```

## ✅ Advantages

* Combines BFS optimality with DFS memory efficiency
* Good for **large state spaces** where depth is unknown
* Completeness and optimality make it suitable for **general-purpose agents**

---

## ❌ Disadvantages

* Repeated state expansions (especially shallow nodes)
* Not ideal if the solution is very deep and the branching factor is huge
* Can be slower than BFS in practice when depth is high

## 📌 IDS vs Other Algorithms

| Feature  | BFS    | DFS    | IDS    |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Complete | ✅      | ❌      | ✅      |
| Optimal  | ✅      | ❌      | ✅      |
| Time     | O(b^d) | O(b^m) | O(b^d) |
| Space    | O(b^d) | O(bm)  | O(bd)  |

## 📚 Real-world Use Cases

* Game tree exploration (like chess or tic-tac-toe)
* Pathfinding in robotics and puzzles
* AI agents where **goal depth is unknown**
* Memory-constrained environments

## 💬 Final Thoughts

**Iterative Deepening Search** is a clever hybrid algorithm that smartly balances the trade-offs of BFS and DFS. Despite the redundant work, its **low memory use and guaranteed optimality** make it a **go-to strategy for AI agents** solving problems with unknown or large depth.
