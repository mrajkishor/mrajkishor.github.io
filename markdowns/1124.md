Here are the **most commonly asked interview questions with answers on Java Collections Framework**, tailored for a **Java Full Stack Developer with 7+ years of experience** (Wipro, TCS, Infosys, or Enterprise-style interviews):

---

### ✅ **1. What is the Java Collections Framework?**

**Answer:**
Java Collections Framework is a **set of interfaces and classes** in `java.util` that allows storing, retrieving, and manipulating groups of data as a single unit.

It includes:

* **Interfaces**: `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`, `Deque`, `Iterable`, `Collection`
* **Implementations**: `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `LinkedList`, `TreeMap`, etc.

### ✅ **2. What is the difference between List, Set, and Map?**

| Feature    | List                      | Set                  | Map                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Duplicates | Allowed                   | Not Allowed          | Keys: No, Values: Allowed    |
| Order      | Maintained                | Not guaranteed       | Keys are unordered (HashMap) |
| Key-Value  | No                        | No                   | Yes                          |
| Examples   | `ArrayList`, `LinkedList` | `HashSet`, `TreeSet` | `HashMap`, `TreeMap`         |

---

### ✅ **3. Difference between HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap?**

| Feature          | HashMap                      | LinkedHashMap   | TreeMap                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Ordering         | No order                     | Insertion order | Sorted by keys (natural/custom) |
| Null Keys/Values | 1 null key, many null values | Same            | No null keys allowed            |
| Performance      | Fastest                      | Slightly slower | Slower (due to sorting)         |

---

### ✅ **4. How does HashMap work internally in Java?**

**Answer:**

* HashMap stores data in **buckets** using an array of `Node<K,V>[]`.
* Each key is hashed using `hashCode()` and then compressed into an index.
* If multiple keys hash to the same index, **chaining** occurs using a **linked list** (Java 7) or **balanced tree** (Java 8+ if >8 collisions).
* Keys must implement `hashCode()` and `equals()` properly.

### ✅ **5. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?**

| Feature            | ArrayList                  | LinkedList                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Data Structure     | Dynamic Array              | Doubly Linked List         |
| Access Time        | Fast (O(1) for get(index)) | Slow (O(n) for get(index)) |
| Insertion/Deletion | Slow (due to shifting)     | Fast (no shifting)         |
| Memory Overhead    | Less                       | More (pointers)            |

---

### ✅ **6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?**

| Feature       | HashSet         | TreeSet                        |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Ordering      | No order        | Sorted (natural or comparator) |
| Performance   | Faster          | Slower (Red-Black Tree)        |
| Null Elements | Allows one null | Null not allowed               |

---

### ✅ **7. What are fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?**

| Type      | Behavior                                                              | Example Classes                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Fail-fast | Throws `ConcurrentModificationException` if modified during iteration | `ArrayList`, `HashMap`                      |
| Fail-safe | Work on a **copy**, no exception                                      | `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList` |

---

### ✅ **8. What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?**

| Feature       | Comparable                         | Comparator                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Interface     | `java.lang.Comparable`             | `java.util.Comparator`       |
| Sorting Logic | In the object itself (`compareTo`) | External class (`compare()`) |
| Used For      | Natural ordering                   | Custom multiple orderings    |

**Example:**

```java
class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> {
    int id;
    public int compareTo(Employee e) {
        return this.id - e.id;
    }
}
```

### ✅ **9. What is the initial capacity and load factor in HashMap?**

**Answer:**

* **Initial Capacity**: Default is **16** (number of buckets).
* **Load Factor**: Default is **0.75** — when 75% full, the map resizes.
* This ensures a tradeoff between **space and time efficiency**.

---

### ✅ **10. What are ConcurrentHashMap and its advantages?**

**Answer:**

* ConcurrentHashMap is a **thread-safe** implementation of HashMap.
* It uses **segmented locks** or **bucket-level locking** (Java 7) and **CAS (compare-and-swap)** + lock stripping in Java 8+.
* No `ConcurrentModificationException` while iterating.
* **Much faster than `Hashtable`** in multithreaded environments.

### ✅ **11. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?**

| Feature          | Iterator              | ListIterator                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Direction        | Forward only          | Forward and backward            |
| Supports Set/Map | Yes                   | No (only List)                  |
| Methods          | `hasNext()`, `next()` | + `hasPrevious()`, `previous()` |
| Modification     | `remove()` only       | `remove()`, `add()`, `set()`    |

---

### ✅ **12. When would you use Queue or Deque in Java?**

* Use `Queue` for **FIFO** operations like messaging systems or task queues.
  `LinkedList`, `PriorityQueue` are examples.

* Use `Deque` for **double-ended operations** (both head and tail).
  `ArrayDeque` is faster than `Stack`.
