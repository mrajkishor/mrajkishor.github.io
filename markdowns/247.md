### **Understanding Remaining SQL Commands**

SQL includes a variety of commands that extend beyond the basic DDL, DML, and DCL operations. These commands help manage transactions, enhance query optimization, and lock resources. In this blog, we'll cover the remaining SQL commands: **CALL**, **EXPLAIN PLAN**, **LOCK TABLE**, **COMMIT**, **SAVEPOINT**, **ROLLBACK**, and **SET TRANSACTION**.

---

## **1. CALL Command**
The `CALL` command is used to execute a stored procedure. Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code that can accept input parameters, perform actions, and return results.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
CALL procedure_name(parameters);
```

#### **Example**
1. **Create a Stored Procedure**:
   ```sql
   CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails (IN empID INT)
   BEGIN
       SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = empID;
   END;
   ```

2. **Call the Procedure**:
   ```sql
   CALL GetEmployeeDetails(1);
   ```
   This executes the `GetEmployeeDetails` procedure and retrieves details of the employee with `EmployeeID = 1`.

---

## **2. EXPLAIN PLAN Command**
The `EXPLAIN PLAN` command provides information about the execution plan for a SQL query. This is useful for query optimization as it shows how the database engine will execute the query.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR query;
```

#### **Example**
```sql
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000;
```
This generates the execution plan for retrieving employees with a salary greater than 50,000.

---

## **3. LOCK TABLE Command**
The `LOCK TABLE` command is used to lock a table to prevent other users from performing specific operations on it during a transaction.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
LOCK TABLE table_name IN lock_mode;
```

#### **Lock Modes**:
- `SHARE MODE`: Allows concurrent reads but blocks writes.
- `EXCLUSIVE MODE`: Blocks both reads and writes.

#### **Example**
```sql
LOCK TABLE Employees IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
```
This locks the `Employees` table so no other user can access it until the transaction is complete.

---

## **4. COMMIT Command**
The `COMMIT` command is used to save all changes made during a transaction to the database permanently.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
COMMIT;
```

#### **Example**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary) VALUES (5, 'Eve', 60000);
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 65000 WHERE EmployeeID = 5;

COMMIT;
```
This ensures that the new record for `Eve` and the salary update are saved permanently.

---

## **5. SAVEPOINT Command**
The `SAVEPOINT` command creates a point within a transaction that you can roll back to without affecting the rest of the transaction.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

#### **Example**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary) VALUES (6, 'Frank', 50000);
SAVEPOINT sp1;

UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 55000 WHERE EmployeeID = 6;
ROLLBACK TO sp1;

COMMIT;
```
This rolls back the salary update but keeps the insert operation intact.

---

## **6. ROLLBACK Command**
The `ROLLBACK` command undoes changes made during a transaction. It can either roll back the entire transaction or to a specific `SAVEPOINT`.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
ROLLBACK; -- Entire transaction
ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name; -- Specific savepoint
```

#### **Example**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary) VALUES (7, 'Grace', 45000);
ROLLBACK; -- Undo the insert operation
```
This undoes the insertion of `Grace`.

---

## **7. SET TRANSACTION Command**
The `SET TRANSACTION` command configures the properties of a transaction, such as isolation level or access mode.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
SET TRANSACTION [ISOLATION LEVEL level] [READ WRITE | READ ONLY];
```

#### **Example**
1. **Set Isolation Level**:
   ```sql
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   ```
   This ensures the highest level of transaction isolation.

2. **Set Read-Only Mode**:
   ```sql
   SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
   ```
   This makes the transaction read-only, preventing data modifications.

### **Practical Scenario: Transaction Management**
Let’s illustrate a real-world scenario combining these commands.

#### Scenario: Processing Salary Payments
1. **Start a Transaction**:
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   ```

2. **Insert Payment Details**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Payments (EmployeeID, Amount, PaymentDate)
   VALUES (1, 50000, '2025-01-01');
   ```

3. **Create a SAVEPOINT**:
   ```sql
   SAVEPOINT sp1;
   ```

4. **Update Employee Salary**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 55000 WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
   ```

5. **Rollback to SAVEPOINT if Necessary**:
   ```sql
   ROLLBACK TO sp1;
   ```

6. **Commit the Transaction**:
   ```sql
   COMMIT;
   ```

### **Key Differences Between Commands**

| Command         | Purpose                                    | Common Usage                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **CALL**        | Executes a stored procedure               | Automating repetitive operations |
| **EXPLAIN PLAN**| Shows query execution plan                | Query optimization               |
| **LOCK TABLE**  | Prevents concurrent access to a table      | Ensures data consistency         |
| **COMMIT**      | Saves all changes in a transaction         | Finalizing a transaction         |
| **SAVEPOINT**   | Creates a rollback point in a transaction  | Partially undoing changes        |
| **ROLLBACK**    | Undoes changes in a transaction            | Reverting transactions           |
| **SET TRANSACTION**| Configures transaction properties       | Managing transaction isolation    |

### **Conclusion**
These remaining SQL commands are crucial for managing advanced database operations. Whether it’s optimizing queries with `EXPLAIN PLAN`, ensuring data integrity with `LOCK TABLE`, or controlling transactions with `COMMIT`, `SAVEPOINT`, and `ROLLBACK`, mastering these commands empowers you to handle complex database scenarios effectively.
