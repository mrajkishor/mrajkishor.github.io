## üßÆ Shift and Add Multiplication

### üîç Definition:

The **Shift and Add** method is a sequential binary multiplication technique used to multiply two fixed-point numbers in **signed magnitude format**. It emulates the long multiplication technique used in decimal systems, operating bit by bit, starting from the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** of the multiplier.

---

### üß† Concept:

At each step:

* If the current multiplier bit (`Qn`) is `1`, **add the multiplicand** to the partial product.
* If `Qn` is `0`, skip the addition.
* In **both cases**, shift the partial result (along with the carry) to the right.
* Repeat the process until all bits of the multiplier are processed.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Components:

To implement this algorithm in hardware, we need:

* **Registers:**

  * `Q`: Stores the **multiplier**.
  * `B`: Stores the **multiplicand**.
  * `A`: Stores the **partial product**.
  * `SC`: Sequence Counter ‚Äì keeps count of the number of bits processed.
* **Flip-Flops:**

  * `E`: Stores carry bit generated during addition.
  * Flip-flops to store **sign bits** of `A`, `B`, and `Q`.
* **Parallel Adder & Complement Logic:**

  * Used to add/subtract contents of `B` with/from `A`.

---

### üß≠ Algorithm Flow:

Referencing the flowchart:

1. **Initialization:**

   * Load `B` (Multiplicand) and `Q` (Multiplier).
   * Set `A = 0`, `E = 0`.
   * Set `SC = n` (number of bits in Q).
   * Determine result **sign** using:

     ```
     Sign = Qs XOR Bs
     ```

2. **Bit Checking Loop (Repeat n times):**

   * **Check LSB of Q (Qn):**

     * If `Qn = 1`:

       * Perform: `A = A + B` (Addition with Carry stored in `E`)
   * **Shift Right:** Perform arithmetic right shift on the combination `E-A-Q`.
   * **Decrement SC** (SC = SC ‚Äì 1)

3. **Termination:**

   * When `SC = 0`, the loop ends.
   * The final product is stored in the combination of **A and Q** registers.

### üìå Example Operation Summary:

| Step | Action              | Result A-Q         | Remarks               |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 1    | Load B in B, Q in Q | A = 0000, Q = 1001 | Initialization        |
| 2    | Qn = 1 ‚Üí A = A + B  | A = A + B          | Perform addition      |
| 3    | Shift Right E-A-Q   | E-A-Q shifted      | Carry flows into MSB  |
| 4    | Repeat for n bits   |                    | Until SC = 0          |
| 5    | Final result in A-Q | Product = A-Q      | End of multiplication |

### ‚úÖ Advantages:

* Simple logic, easy to implement in hardware
* Efficient for small bit-widths
* Mimics manual multiplication logic

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:

* **Slow for large bit sizes** due to sequential processing
* Not optimal for high-speed multipliers; better replaced with **Booth‚Äôs Algorithm** or **Wallace Tree** for larger numbers
