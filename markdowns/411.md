# 🚀 Node.js Cluster Module – Unlocking Multi-Core Power

Node.js is **single-threaded by design**, which means it runs JavaScript code in a single process using a single core. But modern servers usually have **multiple CPU cores**. So how do we utilize them?

That’s where the **`cluster` module** in Node.js comes into play — allowing you to **spawn child processes** (workers) that share the same server port and **fully utilize all CPU cores**.

---

## 🧠 Why Cluster?

Node.js runs on a **single thread**, which means:
- CPU-bound tasks can **block** the event loop.
- Only **one core** is used even on a multi-core system.

Using the **`cluster` module**, you can:
- Scale your application horizontally.
- Handle **more concurrent requests**.
- Achieve better fault isolation (if one worker crashes, others survive).

---

## 🔧 How Does the Cluster Module Work?

The `cluster` module allows you to create a **master process** (also called the primary process) which:
- Forks multiple **worker processes** using `child_process.fork()`.
- Workers share the same port (like port 3000 for HTTP).
- The OS handles **load balancing** between the workers.

---

## 📦 Example: Basic Cluster Setup

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(`Master process ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Fork workers
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  // Listen for dying workers
  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died. Forking a new one...`);
    cluster.fork(); // Auto-restart
  });

} else {
  // Workers share the TCP connection
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(`Handled by worker ${process.pid}\n`);
  }).listen(3000);

  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}
```

### 🔍 How It Works:
- The `master` process forks N number of workers (`N = number of CPU cores`).
- Each worker runs an HTTP server and listens on the same port.
- When a request comes in, Node.js delegates it to an available worker.

---

## 🔐 Fault Tolerance & Restart

You can restart any failed worker using:
```js
cluster.on('exit', (worker) => {
  console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  cluster.fork(); // Restart automatically
});
```

This ensures **high availability** of your Node.js application.

## ⚙️ API Overview

| Method / Property     | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `cluster.isMaster`    | Boolean, true if running in the master process |
| `cluster.fork()`      | Creates a new worker process |
| `cluster.on('exit')`  | Fired when a worker dies |
| `cluster.workers`     | An object containing all active workers |
| `worker.id`           | Unique ID of the worker |
| `worker.kill()`       | Terminates a worker |

---

## ⚠️ Considerations

- Shared memory is **not possible** between workers. Use **Redis**, **database**, or **message queues** to communicate.
- CPU-intensive logic should be **moved to child processes or worker threads**.
- Clustering is **best combined** with a **process manager** like **PM2**.

---

## 🧰 Real-World Use Cases

- **Production web servers** using `express` or `http`.
- **Scalable API backends**.
- Running **job queues** or **batch processors** in parallel.
- **Improving performance** in read-heavy applications.

---

## 🧪 Testing the Load

You can test the performance of clustered vs. non-clustered apps using tools like:
- Apache Benchmark: `ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:3000/`
- Postman Collection Runner
- Artillery.io

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature                     | With Cluster      | Without Cluster   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| CPU Utilization             | ✅ Multi-core      | ❌ Single core     |
| Fault Tolerance             | ✅ Auto restart    | ❌ Manual restart  |
| Performance under load      | ✅ Improved        | ❌ Limited         |
| Code Complexity             | 🔸 Slightly higher | ✅ Simpler         |

The `cluster` module is **a native and powerful way to scale** your Node.js apps to handle production traffic on **multi-core systems**.

## 🔗 Bonus: Combine with PM2

Using PM2 (a process manager) is a popular way to manage clustering without writing custom cluster logic.

```bash
pm2 start app.js -i max
```

> PM2 will automatically fork the number of workers = number of CPU cores.
