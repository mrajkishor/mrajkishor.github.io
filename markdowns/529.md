# 🗂 Managing Multiple Next.js Applications in a Micro Frontend Architecture

## 🧭 Introduction

As applications grow in complexity and teams scale, the **monolithic frontend** becomes a bottleneck for agility, deployment speed, and team independence. That’s why many engineering teams adopt **Micro Frontend (MFE)** architecture — where the frontend is split into **independently developed and deployed applications**, each owning a specific domain.

With **Next.js**, managing multiple apps becomes powerful when combined with tools like **Module Federation**, **Nx**, or **Turborepo**, allowing for scalable and maintainable frontend ecosystems.

## 🧩 What Are Multiple Next.js Applications?

Instead of a single monolithic Next.js app, you maintain **separate Next.js projects** (e.g., `dashboard`, `auth`, `navbar`, `shop`, etc.), each responsible for its own functionality and often owned by different teams.

These apps can:

- Be **independently deployed**
- Share common libraries
- Be composed at runtime (via **Module Federation**) or build time (via **Monorepos**)

---

## 🛠 Approaches to Manage Multiple Next.js Apps

### 1. **Independent Repos per App (Traditional MFE)**

Each Next.js app is:
- In its own repo
- Independently built and deployed
- Loaded into the main app via runtime mechanisms (e.g., Module Federation)

✅ Pros:
- Total isolation
- Suitable for large orgs with CI/CD pipelines

❌ Cons:
- Harder to share code
- More coordination required

---

### 2. **Monorepo (Nx or Turborepo)**

All apps live in one repo with a unified toolchain.

```
apps/
  - dashboard/
  - auth/
  - navbar/
  - blog/

packages/
  - ui-components/
  - hooks/
  - utils/
```

✅ Pros:
- Easy code sharing
- Centralized versioning
- Faster local development

❌ Cons:
- Needs tooling (Nx, Turborepo) for caching, build orchestration

---

### 3. **Module Federation (Runtime Integration)**

Use Webpack 5 Module Federation to **expose components** from one Next.js app and **import them dynamically** into another.

This enables:

- Cross-app component sharing
- Remote loading of UIs (e.g., navbar, footer, marketing banner)
- Fully decoupled deployments

> 🔗 Combine Module Federation with monorepo setup for best of both worlds

## 🔧 Tools for Managing Multiple Next.js Apps

| Tool        | Purpose                               |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Nx`        | Build orchestration, dependency graph  |
| `Turborepo` | Fast builds, caching, monorepo layout  |
| `nextjs-mf` | Webpack 5 Module Federation plugin     |
| `Docker`    | Containerized local dev environments   |
| `pnpm workspaces` | Dependency isolation per app     |

---

## 🗃 Shared Libraries and Utilities

Use the `packages/` folder in monorepos to hold shared:

- `ui-components/` → Buttons, Layouts, Forms
- `utils/` → Formatters, API helpers
- `hooks/` → Shared React hooks
- `constants/` → Shared enums, routes

Shared packages are imported like npm modules:

```js
import { Button } from '@ui-components/Button';
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategies

| Strategy                     | Description                                              |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Independent Deployments     | Each app has its own CI/CD pipeline                      |
| CDN + Remote Entry (MF)     | Remote apps expose a `remoteEntry.js` to be consumed     |
| Edge Functions              | Deploy each app's API routes to edge servers             |
| Vercel Monorepo Deployment  | Vercel supports monorepo auto-routing per app            |

---

## 🛠 Best Practices

- ✅ Use consistent ESLint, TSConfig, Prettier across apps
- ✅ Define `basePath` or route namespaces (`/auth`, `/shop`) per app
- ✅ Use health checks for each deployed app
- ✅ Version and test shared libraries before release
- ✅ Use `ssr: false` when importing remote modules via Module Federation

---

## 📦 Real-World Use Cases

- **E-commerce platforms**: `shop`, `cart`, `checkout`, `profile`, `dashboard`
- **B2B SaaS apps**: `analytics`, `billing`, `support`, `settings`
- **Marketing sites**: `homepage`, `blog`, `docs` as separate remotes

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Managing multiple Next.js apps in a micro frontend setup allows large teams to build, test, and deploy independently — while maintaining a unified user experience. Whether you choose monorepo with Turborepo/Nx or runtime composition with Module Federation, Next.js provides the flexibility to scale frontend systems the same way you scale backend microservices.

> Micro Frontends in Next.js unlock **team autonomy**, **performance**, and **faster shipping cycles** — without sacrificing code quality.
