# 🛡️ Best Practices for Next.js Security  


## 🧭 Introduction

Next.js enables full-stack development with React, allowing you to build APIs, UI components, and server-rendered pages in one unified framework. While it handles performance and routing well, **security is your responsibility**.

This guide walks through **essential best practices to secure your Next.js application** — from protecting API routes to defending against XSS and CSRF.

---

## 🔐 1. Use HTTPS Everywhere

- Always deploy your app with HTTPS using trusted certificates.
- Platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **Cloudflare** provide HTTPS by default.
- For custom servers, use **Let's Encrypt** with Nginx/Apache.

✅ **Why**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and protects tokens and credentials in transit.

---

## 🚪 2. Secure API Routes

- ✅ Authenticate users using `NextAuth.js`, `JWT`, or custom sessions.
- ✅ Authorize access based on **roles** or **permissions**.
- ✅ Validate request bodies and query params using libraries like `zod` or `yup`.
- ✅ Use HTTP method guards:
  ```js
  if (req.method !== 'POST') return res.status(405).end();
  ```
- ✅ Set secure headers like:
  ```js
  res.setHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
  res.setHeader("X-Frame-Options", "DENY");
  ```

---

## 🔒 3. Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary.
- Sanitize all HTML input using libraries like:
  ```bash
  npm install dompurify
  ```
- When rendering Markdown, sanitize content with:
  ```js
  import rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize';
  ```

✅ React escapes JSX by default, but HTML rendering needs extra care.

---

## 🎯 4. Defend Against CSRF

- Use **HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite cookies** to mitigate CSRF.
- If using cookie-based auth, add CSRF tokens (e.g., with `csurf`).
- Verify `Origin` and `Referer` headers on critical endpoints.

---

## ⚔️ 5. Protect Against Clickjacking

- Add `X-Frame-Options` header:
  ```js
  res.setHeader("X-Frame-Options", "DENY");
  ```

✅ Prevents your app from being embedded in iframes.

---

## 🔑 6. Manage Secrets Securely

- Store environment variables in `.env.local` or in secure platform env dashboards.
- Never expose them in client-side code (`NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix exposes them).
- Avoid committing secrets to version control.

---

## 📦 7. Use Middleware for Access Control (Next.js 13+)

Create `middleware.ts` to:

- Block malicious paths or IPs
- Check auth tokens before routing
- Rate-limit or geo-restrict access

```ts
export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth');
  if (!token) return NextResponse.redirect('/login');
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

---

## 📜 8. Enable Content Security Policy (CSP)

Use a strict CSP header to prevent inline scripts and injections:

```js
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self';
```

✅ Prevents XSS and malicious third-party content.

## 📊 9. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

- Use **LRU Cache**, **Redis**, or **edge/CDN-level WAFs** to limit repeated requests.
- Services like **Vercel Edge Middleware** or **Cloudflare** offer global protection.

---

## 🧪 10. Security Testing & Audits

- Regularly run:
  ```bash
  npm audit fix
  ```
- Use security tools like:
  - [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
  - [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)
  - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
