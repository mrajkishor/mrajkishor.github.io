## üöÄ Module Federation 2 ‚Äì What‚Äôs New?

### üß† Quick Recap (v1)

In **Module Federation v1**, you define:

* `remotes` ‚Üí code you want to consume
* `exposes` ‚Üí code you want others to consume
* `shared` ‚Üí dependencies like `react` that need to be synchronized

It was powerful but had **some limitations**:

* Remotes were often **statically defined**
* Managing **version conflicts** and **async module updates** was tricky
* There was no concept of **plugin layers** or middleware-like handling

---

## üÜï What's New in Module Federation 2?

### 1. üîÑ **Asynchronous Remote Containers**

You can now **load remote containers asynchronously at runtime** without relying on static URLs in `webpack.config.js`.

**Why it matters:**
Perfect for **dynamic host apps** where the list of remotes changes based on route, tenant, or deployment.

> Example: Imagine loading a plugin from a 3rd-party team without knowing it at build time.

---

### 2. üîÉ **Fallbacks for Remote Modules**

You can now define **fallback modules** in case the remote fails to load or a module is missing.

```js
remotes: {
  someApp: 'someApp@http://remote-app.com/remoteEntry.js',
},
federationPlugin: {
  fallback: {
    './Header': './FallbackHeader'
  }
}
```

Helps build **more resilient microfrontend apps**.

---

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è **Federated Middleware (Plugin Layer)**

Module Federation 2 introduces an **interceptor-like plugin system**, so you can hook into:

* Module resolution
* Sharing
* Fallback handling

You can create **federation-aware logic** like logging, dynamic security layers, conditional version loading, etc.

---

### 4. üì¶ **Improved Shared Versioning Logic**

Versioning is now more robust:

* Handles **major and minor version mismatches**
* Supports **advanced semver negotiation**
* Can dynamically resolve which version to load at runtime

> Great for large orgs where teams might not always sync React, etc.

---

### 5. üß™ **Federated Types (Experimental)**

There‚Äôs an effort to support **TypeScript types across federated modules**, helping with:

* Autocomplete
* Type safety
* IDE awareness

Still evolving, but a massive help for dev experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Using Module Federation 2

To use MF2 features, you‚Äôll generally use:

* Webpack 5.75+ (MF2 started being more stable post-5.74)
* [`@module-federation/enhanced`](https://github.com/module-federation/enhanced) for advanced features (like plugin hooks, middlewares, fallbacks)
* Dynamic host apps (e.g. plugin platforms, CMS-based remotes)

## üéØ Use Cases It Unlocks

| Scenario                      | Benefit of MF2                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Multi-tenant SaaS             | Dynamically load tenant-specific remotes  |
| CMS or plugin-based platforms | Load plugins at runtime without config    |
| Design systems                | Provide fallbacks for missing UI packages |
| Org-level version drift       | Smart version resolution across teams     |

---

### üìù Summary

| Feature                      | Introduced In |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Async remote loading         | MF2           |
| Fallback modules             | MF2           |
| Federation plugin middleware | MF2           |
| Advanced version negotiation | MF2           |
| Type sharing (experimental)  | MF2           |
