### 🛠️ What is **Husky**?


> Note: Husky is not a microfrontend framework or build tool, but a Git hook manager that helps enforce code quality by running scripts (like linting, formatting, or testing) automatically before Git actions such as commits or pushes. It improves consistency and reliability across large codebases by catching issues early in the developer workflow.

**Husky** is a lightweight and powerful tool for managing **Git hooks** in JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It allows you to run custom scripts automatically at specific points in the Git lifecycle, such as before commits, pushes, merges, or checkouts.

> 📌 Think of Husky as a **Git automation assistant** — it ensures that your code follows certain rules *before* it enters version control.

### 🔹 Why Use Husky?

* Prevent **bad code** from being committed or pushed.
* Enforce **code formatting**, **linting**, or **testing** at commit time.
* Automate checks like **commit message validation** or **branch name rules**.
* Integrate seamlessly with tools like **Lint-Staged**, **ESLint**, **Prettier**, **Commitlint**, and **TypeScript**.

### 🔧 Common Use Cases

| Git Hook     | Example Use                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre-commit` | Run linting or unit tests before committing          |
| `commit-msg` | Validate commit messages using `commitlint`          |
| `pre-push`   | Run build or test suite before pushing to remote     |
| `post-merge` | Automatically install dependencies or run migrations |

### 🛠️ How to Set Up Husky (Modern v7+)

#### 1. **Install Husky**

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
```

#### 2. **Enable Git Hooks**

```bash
npx husky install
```

Then, add this to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Add Hooks**

Create a `pre-commit` hook:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint"
```

Create a `commit-msg` hook:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx commitlint --edit $1"
```

---

### 📁 Folder Structure

```bash
project-root/
├── .husky/
│   ├── pre-commit
│   └── commit-msg
├── package.json
```

Hooks are simple shell scripts inside the `.husky` folder.

### 🤝 Integration with Other Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                          | Command Example                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Lint-Staged** | Run linters only on staged files | `"lint": "lint-staged"` in `pre-commit`    |
| **ESLint**      | Code quality checks              | `npx eslint . --fix`                       |
| **Prettier**    | Auto-format code                 | `npx prettier --write .`                   |
| **Commitlint**  | Enforce conventional commits     | `npx commitlint --edit $1` in `commit-msg` |

### ⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind

| Caution                       | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not cross-platform by default | Husky scripts are shell-based; write cross-compatible scripts |
| Not run in CI/CD              | Git hooks don’t trigger in CI/CD unless manually configured   |
| Shouldn’t block work          | Keep hooks lightweight to avoid slowing down commits          |

---

### 🌍 Real-World Examples

* **Large-scale repos** use Husky to enforce consistent code formatting and linting.
* **Design system teams** use `pre-push` hooks to prevent broken builds.
* **Open-source projects** use `commit-msg` to ensure readable commit history.
