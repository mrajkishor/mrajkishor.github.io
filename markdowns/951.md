### 📌 What is a System Call?

A **system call** is the main way for a **user program** to request a **service** from the **operating system's kernel**.

User programs (like a C program or Python script) **run in user mode**, meaning they don’t have direct access to hardware resources like memory, files, or network. So when a program needs to do something low-level (like read a file, allocate memory, or create a process), it **calls the OS** using a **system call**.

### 🧩 Simple Analogy:

Imagine you’re sitting in a library and need a book from a restricted section.
You **can’t go there yourself** — instead, you ask the librarian (OS) to fetch it.
This request is your **system call**.

---

### 🛠️ Why Are System Calls Needed?

Because user programs:

* 🔒 Cannot access **hardware directly**
* 🔐 Need controlled access to **I/O devices, memory, and processes**
* 🧰 Use system calls to **interface with the OS safely**

---

### ⚙️ How a System Call Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **User Program Calls a Library Function**
   For example: `read()` or `printf()` in C.

2. **Library Function Triggers a Trap Instruction**
   This switches the CPU from **user mode** to **kernel mode** (privileged mode).

3. **Kernel Handles the Request**
   The OS checks parameters, performs the operation (like reading a file), and stores the result.

4. **Control Returns to User Mode**
   The result is returned to the user program, and execution continues.

### 💡 Example (C Language)

```c
int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
```

Here:

* The user calls `open()`
* It internally triggers a **system call** to the OS to open the file
* The kernel assigns a **file descriptor** and returns it

### 🔍 Common System Calls Categories

| Category                | Example System Calls           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Process control         | `fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()`   |
| File management         | `open()`, `read()`, `write()`  |
| Device management       | `ioctl()`, `read()`, `write()` |
| Information maintenance | `getpid()`, `alarm()`          |
| Communication           | `pipe()`, `shmget()`, `send()` |

### 🧠 Key Terms

* **Trap**: A software interrupt to switch from user to kernel mode
* **Kernel Mode**: A privileged mode where OS can access hardware
* **User Mode**: A restricted mode for regular apps

---

### 📘 Fun Fact (GATE Insight)

* In GATE, you may get MCQs asking:

  * Which instruction switches from user to kernel? → *Trap*
  * What’s returned by `fork()`? → *Child PID to parent, 0 to child*

---

### 📝 Summary

* A system call is a **controlled entry point** into the kernel.
* It allows **user-level applications** to request **privileged operations**.
* It is central to the OS's role as a **resource manager and protector**.
