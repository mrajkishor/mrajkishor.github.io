# 🚀 Deploying on Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, or AWS with Next.js  

## 🧭 Introduction

After building your high-performance Next.js application, the final step is deployment — making it accessible to the world. Next.js offers flexible deployment options, supporting **serverless**, **static**, and **hybrid** apps.

In this guide, we’ll walk through **deploying Next.js to Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, and AWS**, covering:

- Setup steps  
- Pros and cons  
- Special considerations for SSR or API routes

---

## 🟢 1. Deploying on **Vercel** (Official Platform)

Vercel is the **creator of Next.js** and offers the most seamless experience.

### ✅ Steps

1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in.
3. Click **"New Project"**, import your repo.
4. Vercel auto-detects Next.js and sets:
   - Build Command: `next build`
   - Output: `.next`
5. Click **"Deploy"**.

### 🌐 Features
- Built-in serverless support  
- Supports SSR, ISR, SSG  
- Custom domains, previews, analytics  
- Edge middleware, environment variables  

### ⚠️ Notes
- Free tier is generous  
- Supports API routes, middleware  
- Can handle `app/` directory (Next.js 13+)

## 🟡 2. Deploying on **Netlify**

Netlify supports **static and hybrid** Next.js apps, though SSR has limitations.

### ✅ Steps

1. Add plugin:
   ```bash
   npm install @netlify/plugin-nextjs
   ```
2. Create `netlify.toml` file:
   ```toml
   [build]
   command = "npm run build"
   publish = ".next"
   ```
3. Push to GitHub and connect to Netlify.
4. Netlify will auto-detect and deploy.

### ⚠️ Notes
- Supports ISR/SSG out of the box  
- SSR via On-Demand Builders (needs plugin)  
- Limited serverless API support  
- Best for static-heavy sites

## 🔥 3. Deploying on **Firebase Hosting + Functions**

Firebase is great for hosting SPAs and using Firebase Functions for server-side logic.

### ✅ Steps

1. Install CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   firebase login
   firebase init
   ```
2. Choose:
   - Hosting (static)
   - Functions (API or SSR)

3. In `firebase.json`, configure rewrites:
   ```json
   {
     "hosting": {
       "public": "out",
       "rewrites": [
         {
           "source": "**",
           "function": "nextApp"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

4. Deploy:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

### ⚠️ Notes
- Use `next export` for pure static hosting
- Use **Cloud Functions** for SSR  
- Great if you're using Firebase Auth, DB, etc.

---

## 🟠 4. Deploying on **AWS (S3 + CloudFront or Lambda)**

AWS provides **maximum control**, suitable for enterprise-scale deployment.

### ✅ Option A: Static Export via S3 + CloudFront

1. Run:
   ```bash
   next export
   ```
   This generates static HTML in `/out`.

2. Upload `/out` to S3, enable static hosting.

3. Set up CloudFront for CDN.

✅ Great for pure static apps.

---

### ✅ Option B: SSR with AWS Lambda

1. Use `serverless-next.js`:

   ```bash
   npm install @sls-next/serverless-component
   ```

2. Create `serverless.yml`:

   ```yaml
   component: "@sls-next/serverless-component"
   inputs:
     domain:
       - yourdomain.com
   ```

3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npx serverless
   ```

✅ Supports full SSR, API routes  
✅ Integrates with API Gateway + Lambda

## 📊 Platform Comparison

| Platform  | SSR Support | Static Export | API Routes | Serverless | Custom Domain | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Vercel    | ✅ Full      | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Easy        | Best overall |
| Netlify   | ⚠️ Partial   | ✅ Yes         | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Plugin   | ✅ Easy        | Great for SSG |
| Firebase  | ⚠️ via Func | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Medium      | Works with Firebase stack |
| AWS       | ✅ Full      | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Custom      | Most control, most config |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **environment variables** (e.g., `.env.local`) — don’t hardcode secrets.
- Setup **preview environments** with CI/CD.
- Configure custom domains with **HTTPS**.
- Use **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** if using Vercel.
- Add **headers**, **rewrites**, and **redirects** in `next.config.js`.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

Next.js makes your app performant — now make it accessible! Whether you prefer the simplicity of Vercel or the flexibility of AWS, there’s a perfect deployment strategy for every use case.

> Pick based on your **app complexity**, **scaling needs**, and **developer experience**.
