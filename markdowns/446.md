# 🛠️ Hands-On with Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is the backbone of persistent block storage for EC2 in AWS. While theory helps you understand the basics, **hands-on practice** makes your knowledge concrete. In this guide, we’ll walk through a complete EBS setup using the AWS Console.

---

## 🎯 Objective

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:
- Create an EBS volume
- Attach it to an EC2 instance
- Format and mount it
- Persist data
- Configure "Delete on Termination"
- Take a snapshot and restore it

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites

- AWS account
- EC2 Linux instance (Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, etc.)
- IAM user with EC2 and EBS permissions

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Create an EBS Volume

1. Go to **AWS Console → EC2 → Volumes**.
2. Click **Create Volume**.
3. Choose:
   - **Size**: e.g., 10 GiB
   - **Availability Zone**: Must match your EC2 instance AZ
   - **Volume Type**: General Purpose SSD (gp3/gp2)
4. Click **Create Volume**.

📝 *Note: EBS volumes are AZ-specific. You can only attach them to EC2s in the same AZ.*

---

## 🔗 Step 2: Attach the Volume to EC2

1. Select the created volume → Click **Actions → Attach Volume**.
2. Choose the EC2 instance from the list.
3. Device name: e.g., `/dev/xvdf`
4. Click **Attach**.

---

## 💽 Step 3: SSH into EC2 and Format the Volume

1. SSH into your EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>
```

2. List block devices:

```bash
lsblk
```

You should see something like:

```
xvda   8:0    20G  root
xvdf   8:16   10G
```

3. Format the volume:

```bash
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
```

---

## 📁 Step 4: Mount the EBS Volume

1. Create a directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /data
```

2. Mount the volume:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
```

3. Verify it:

```bash
df -h
```

---

## 📂 Step 5: Make the Mount Persistent

1. Get the UUID:

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/xvdf
```

2. Edit the fstab file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

3. Add this line at the end:

```bash
UUID=<your-uuid> /data ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2
```

Press `Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl + X`.

---

## 🧹 Step 6: Test Persistence

1. Reboot the instance:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

2. SSH again and verify:

```bash
df -h
```

You should still see `/data` mounted correctly.

---

## 🗑 Step 7: Manage Delete on Termination

To **preserve** or **delete** EBS volume when the EC2 instance is terminated:

1. Go to **EC2 → Instances → Storage tab**
2. Click the volume → Modify the attribute `Delete on Termination`.
3. Set it according to your use case:
   - ✅ Checked: Deleted with instance
   - ❌ Unchecked: Preserved after termination

---

## 📸 Step 8: Take a Snapshot

1. Go to **EC2 → Volumes**
2. Select your volume → Click **Actions → Create Snapshot**
3. Give it a name and description → Click **Create Snapshot**

---

## 💾 Step 9: Restore from Snapshot

1. Go to **Snapshots** → Select snapshot → **Actions → Create Volume**
2. Choose the AZ and size → Click **Create Volume**
3. Attach and mount as before.

## 🧠 Summary

| Task                     | Command / Location |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Create Volume            | EC2 → Volumes       |
| Attach to EC2            | Actions → Attach    |
| Format Volume            | `mkfs -t ext4`      |
| Mount Volume             | `mount /dev/xvdf`   |
| Persist Mount            | Add to `/etc/fstab` |
| Delete on Termination    | Storage tab (EC2)   |
| Create Snapshot          | EC2 → Volumes       |
| Restore Snapshot         | EC2 → Snapshots     |

## 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

- Attach additional storage for logs or backups
- Use snapshots for backup and disaster recovery
- Resize EBS volumes without losing data
- Automate with Terraform or AWS CLI for devops use

---

## 📘 Bonus: CLI Commands

```bash
# Create volume
aws ec2 create-volume --size 10 --availability-zone us-east-1a --volume-type gp2

# Attach volume
aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id vol-xxxxxx --instance-id i-xxxxxx --device /dev/xvdf

# Create snapshot
aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-xxxxxx --description "Backup snapshot"
```

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Amazon EBS is essential for building reliable cloud infrastructure. Mastering its hands-on usage—from creation to snapshotting—equips you with the skills needed for real-world AWS projects.
