# 🌀 **Program Loops**

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow **repeating a block of code** multiple times until a specific condition is met. They are essential for tasks like iteration over arrays, repeated calculations, and automating processes.

There are different types of loops, but this note focuses on:

* `while` loop
* `do...while` loop

---

## 🔁 **1. The `while` Loop**

### ✅ **Syntax:**

```c
while (condition) {
   // loop body
}
```

### 📌 **Explanation:**

* The `while` loop **evaluates the condition first**.
* If the condition is **true (non-zero)**, the loop body is executed.
* After each iteration, the condition is checked again.
* The loop terminates when the condition evaluates to **false (zero)**.

### 🔍 **Important Characteristics:**

| Point                         | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Starts with `while` keyword | Followed by a condition in parentheses `()`                     |
| ✅ Curly braces `{}`           | Used to wrap multiple statements inside the loop body           |
| ✅ Optional braces             | If the loop body has **only one line**, `{}` can be omitted     |
| 🔁 Repeats                    | Until the condition becomes **false**                           |
| ⚠️ Risk                       | May result in **infinite loop** if the condition is never false |

### 📘 **Example:**

```c
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## 🔁 **2. The `do...while` Loop**

### ✅ **Syntax:**

```c
do {
   // loop body
} while (condition);
```

### 📌 **Explanation:**

* The `do...while` loop **executes the body at least once** before checking the condition.
* After executing the loop body once, it checks the condition.
* If the condition is true, it repeats the body again.

### 🔍 **Key Differences from `while`:**

| Feature               | `while` Loop           | `do...while` Loop                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Condition Check**   | Before the loop body   | After the loop body                             |
| **Minimum Execution** | May not execute at all | Executes at least **once**                      |
| **Syntax End**        | Ends with `}`          | Ends with `} while (condition);` (note the `;`) |

### 📘 **Example:**

```c
int i = 1;
do {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### 📘 **Edge Case Example:**

```c
int i = 10;
do {
    printf("%d\n", i);
} while (i < 5);
```

**Output:**

```
10
```

(Even though the condition is false initially, it still runs once.)

## 🧠 **Use Cases Summary**

| Loop Type    | Best For                                                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `while`      | When you need to **check the condition first**                               |
| `do...while` | When you want the loop body to **run at least once** regardless of condition |

---

## 🔚 **Conclusion**

Both `while` and `do...while` loops are fundamental to programming. The choice between them depends on **when you want the condition checked**—**before** or **after** executing the loop body. Using the right loop structure can make your programs cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand.
