### 🔹 Topic: **Graph Terminologies (Vertex, Edge, Degree)**

## 🔹 1. What is a Graph?

A **graph** is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects.
It is defined as:

```
G = (V, E)
```

Where:

* `V` is a set of **vertices** (or nodes)
* `E` is a set of **edges** (connections or links between pairs of vertices)

---

## 🔹 2. Terminologies

### ✅ A. Vertex (Node)

* A **vertex** represents an entity or point in the graph.
* Denoted typically as `v ∈ V`
* In programming, this could represent cities, people, computers, etc.

📌 Example:
In a graph of cities, each city is a **vertex**.

---

### ✅ B. Edge (Link)

* An **edge** is a connection between two vertices.
* Denoted as `(u, v)` where `u, v ∈ V`
* Can be:

  * **Undirected**: `(u, v)` means connection in both directions
  * **Directed (Arc)**: `<u, v>` means connection from `u` to `v` only

📌 Example:
In a flight network, a direct flight from city A to city B is a **directed edge**.

---

### ✅ C. Degree

The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges incident (connected) to it.

#### 1. **Undirected Graph**

* **Degree of a vertex v**: number of edges connected to `v`

  ```
  deg(v) = number of edges incident on v
  ```
* **Sum of degrees of all vertices = 2 × number of edges**

  ```
  ∑ deg(v) = 2|E|
  ```

#### 2. **Directed Graph**

* Each edge has a direction (from u to v)

* **In-degree (deg⁻)**: number of edges coming **into** the vertex

  ```
  in_deg(v) = number of incoming edges to v
  ```

* **Out-degree (deg⁺)**: number of edges going **out** of the vertex

  ```
  out_deg(v) = number of outgoing edges from v
  ```

* **Sum of all in-degrees = sum of all out-degrees = |E|**

📌 Example:
For a directed graph:
`A → B`, `B → C`, `C → A`

* `deg⁺(A) = 1`, `deg⁻(A) = 1`
* `deg⁺(B) = 1`, `deg⁻(B) = 1`
* `deg⁺(C) = 1`, `deg⁻(C) = 1`

## 🔹 3. Special Terms Related to Vertices and Edges

| Term              | Definition                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adjacent Vertices | Two vertices connected directly by an edge              |
| Isolated Vertex   | A vertex with degree 0 (no edges)                       |
| Self-loop         | An edge from a vertex to itself (counts as 2 in degree) |
| Parallel Edges    | Multiple edges between the same pair of vertices        |
| Simple Graph      | No self-loops or parallel edges                         |
| Multigraph        | Graph with parallel edges or loops                      |

## 🔹 4. Types of Graphs (Overview)

| Graph Type       | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Undirected Graph | All edges are bidirectional                   |
| Directed Graph   | Edges have direction (`u → v`)                |
| Weighted Graph   | Each edge has a weight (cost, distance, etc.) |
| Unweighted Graph | No weights on edges                           |
| Simple Graph     | No loops or multiple edges                    |
| Multigraph       | Multiple edges allowed between same nodes     |

## 🔹 5. Example Diagram

```
Graph G = (V, E)

V = {A, B, C, D}
E = {(A,B), (A,C), (B,C), (C,D)}

Degrees (Undirected):
deg(A) = 2
deg(B) = 2
deg(C) = 3
deg(D) = 1

Total degree = 8 = 2 × |E|
```

## 🔹 6. GATE PYQ-Style MCQs

### Q1. In an undirected graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges, what is the sum of degrees of all vertices?

**A.** 15
**B.** 30
**C.** 10
**D.** 45

✅ **Answer:** B
(Sum of degrees = 2 × number of edges = 2 × 15 = 30)

---

### Q2. What is the minimum number of edges in a connected graph with 5 vertices?

**A.** 4
**B.** 5
**C.** 6
**D.** 0

✅ **Answer:** A
(To be connected and form a tree → needs `n - 1` = 4 edges)

---

### Q3. In a directed graph, the sum of in-degrees of all vertices is:

**A.** Equal to sum of out-degrees
**B.** Twice the number of edges
**C.** Number of vertices
**D.** Undefined

✅ **Answer:** A
(In a directed graph, total in-degree = total out-degree = |E|)

## 🔍 Summary Table

| Term         | Undirected Graph         | Directed Graph                    |   |   |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | - | - |
| Degree       | Number of incident edges | In-degree / Out-degree            |   |   |
| Total Degree | 2 × number of edges      | In-deg sum = Out-deg sum =        | E |   |
| Self-loop    | Adds 2 to degree         | Adds 1 to in-deg and 1 to out-deg |   |   |

## ✅ GATE Tips

* Remember **degree sum formula** for undirected and directed graphs
* Practice drawing small graphs and computing degree manually
* Know how self-loops and parallel edges affect degrees
* GATE may give **partial graphs** and ask degree-based MCQs
