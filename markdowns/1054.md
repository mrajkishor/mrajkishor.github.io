### A* (A-Star) Search Algorithm

---

## üöÄ Introduction

The **A\*** (**A-Star**) algorithm is a **heuristic-based shortest path algorithm** widely used in **AI, robotics, and pathfinding problems** (e.g., Google Maps, games). It combines the strengths of **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** and **Greedy Best-First Search**, ensuring **optimal** and **efficient** results ‚Äî especially on large graphs.

---

## üß† Key Concept

A\* uses a **cost function**:

$$
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
$$

Where:

* `g(n)` = actual cost from the source to node `n`
* `h(n)` = estimated (heuristic) cost from node `n` to the goal
* `f(n)` = total estimated cost of the cheapest path via `n`

If `h(n)` is **admissible** (never overestimates the cost), then A\* is **guaranteed to find the shortest path**.

---

## üìå When to Use

* When you have **prior knowledge** or **heuristics** about the destination
* For **grid-based pathfinding**, like in maps, games, routing problems
* Graphs with **positive edge weights**

## üìö Algorithm Steps

### Inputs:

* Graph `G(V, E)`
* Source node `start`
* Destination node `goal`
* A heuristic function `h(n)`

---

### Core Data Structures:

* `openSet`: priority queue (min-heap) containing nodes to be evaluated (ordered by `f(n)`)
* `cameFrom[]`: maps each node to its parent (to reconstruct path)
* `gScore[]`: actual cost from start to each node (initialized to ‚àû)
* `fScore[]`: total estimated cost (g + h) for each node

---

### Pseudocode:

```python
function AStar(Graph, start, goal, h):
    openSet = PriorityQueue()
    openSet.push(start, f=0)

    gScore[start] = 0
    fScore[start] = h(start)

    while openSet is not empty:
        current = openSet.pop()

        if current == goal:
            return reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current)

        for neighbor in neighbors(current):
            tentative_gScore = gScore[current] + weight(current, neighbor)
            if tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]:
                cameFrom[neighbor] = current
                gScore[neighbor] = tentative_gScore
                fScore[neighbor] = tentative_gScore + h(neighbor)
                if neighbor not in openSet:
                    openSet.push(neighbor, fScore[neighbor])
```

### üîç Heuristic Function `h(n)` Examples:

| Graph/Grid Type  | Heuristic `h(n)`                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 2D Grid          | Manhattan Distance: `abs(x1‚àíx2) + abs(y1‚àíy2)`      |
| 2D Diagonal Grid | Euclidean Distance or Chebyshev Distance           |
| General Graphs   | Domain-specific heuristic (e.g., airline distance) |

---

## üß™ Example

### Grid:

```
S - A - B - G
```

* All edges = 1
* Heuristic `h(n)` = direct distance to `G`
* A\* will choose nodes that **minimize f(n)**

```
f(A) = g(S‚ÜíA) + h(A)
     = 1 + 2 = 3
f(B) = g(S‚ÜíA‚ÜíB) + h(B)
     = 2 + 1 = 3
f(G) = g(S‚ÜíA‚ÜíB‚ÜíG) + h(G)
     = 3 + 0 = 3
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Time Complexity  | O(E √ó log V) (with heap) |
| Space Complexity | O(V)                     |

> In worst-case: explores large parts of graph, but typically faster than Dijkstra when a good heuristic is available.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* **Heuristic must be admissible** (must never overestimate the cost)
* **Not optimal** if `h(n)` is too aggressive or poorly chosen
* Can use **a lot of memory** due to `openSet` and `cameFrom` tracking

## üß† GATE-Relevant Points

| Topic                 | GATE-Focused Insight                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| f(n) = g(n) + h(n)    | Know the formula cold!                 |
| When is A\* optimal?  | When `h(n)` is admissible & consistent |
| Compare with Dijkstra | Dijkstra is A\* with `h(n) = 0`        |
| Heuristic examples    | Manhattan, Euclidean, etc.             |
| Edge Weights          | Only **non-negative** weights          |
