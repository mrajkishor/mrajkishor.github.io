### **Mastering SQL Wildcards: A Complete Guide with Examples**

Wildcards in SQL allow for flexible pattern matching in string data. They are used with the **LIKE** operator to search for patterns and can significantly simplify queries when dealing with complex or partial data searches.

This blog provides a detailed overview of SQL wildcards, their syntax, use cases, and practical examples.

### **What Are Wildcards in SQL?**

Wildcards are special characters used to represent one or more characters in a string. They enable pattern matching, which is helpful for filtering data based on partial or flexible conditions. Wildcards are primarily used with the **LIKE** operator but can also be combined with other operators for advanced filtering.

### **Types of SQL Wildcards**

| Wildcard Symbol | Description                                  | Example                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **`%`**         | Represents zero or more characters.          | `LIKE 'A%'` matches "Alice," "Alan," etc. |
| **`_`**         | Represents exactly one character.            | `LIKE 'B_'` matches "Be" but not "Brian."|
| **`[]`**        | Matches any single character within the brackets. | `LIKE '[A-C]%'` matches "Alice".   |
| **`[^]`**       | Matches any single character not in the brackets (SQL Server only). | `LIKE '[^A-C]%'` excludes "Bob".|
| **`ESCAPE`**    | Escapes special wildcard characters.          | Searches for literal `%` or `_`.          |

### **Syntax for Using Wildcards**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';
```

---

### **1. Using `%` Wildcard**

The `%` wildcard represents zero, one, or multiple characters in a string.

#### **Example 1: Names Starting with "A"**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE 'A%';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names starting with "A" followed by zero or more characters.

**Result**:
| Name      |
|-----------|
| Alice     |
| Alan      |

---

#### **Example 2: Names Ending with "n"**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE '%n';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names ending with "n."

**Result**:
| Name      |
|-----------|
| Alan      |

---

#### **Example 3: Names Containing "li"**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE '%li%';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names containing "li" anywhere.

**Result**:
| Name      |
|-----------|
| Alice     |

---

### **2. Using `_` Wildcard**

The `_` wildcard matches exactly one character.

#### **Example 1: Names Starting with "A" and Followed by Exactly One Character**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE 'A_';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names starting with "A" followed by exactly one character.

**Result**:
| Name |
|------|
| Alan |

---

#### **Example 2: Names with Exactly Five Characters**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE '_____';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names that are exactly five characters long.

**Result**:
| Name      |
|-----------|
| Alice     |

---

### **3. Using `[]` Wildcard**

The `[]` wildcard matches any single character within the brackets. It is specific to SQL Server.

#### **Example 1: Names Starting with "A" or "B"**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE '[AB]%';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names starting with "A" or "B."

**Result**:
| Name      |
|-----------|
| Alice     |
| Bob       |

---

#### **Example 2: Names Starting with Any Character Between "C" and "E"**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE '[C-E]%';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names starting with "C," "D," or "E."

**Result**:
| Name      |
|-----------|
| Charlie   |

---

### **4. Using `[^]` Wildcard**

The `[^]` wildcard matches any single character **not** within the brackets (specific to SQL Server).

#### **Example 1: Names Not Starting with "A" or "B"**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE '[^AB]%';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names not starting with "A" or "B."

**Result**:
| Name      |
|-----------|
| Charlie   |
| Diana     |

---

### **5. Using Wildcards with the `ESCAPE` Keyword**

The `ESCAPE` keyword allows you to search for actual wildcard characters like `%` or `_`.

#### **Example: Searching for "50%"**
**Sales Table**:

| SaleID | SaleDetail  |
|--------|-------------|
| 1      | 50% Off     |
| 2      | Buy 1 Get 1 |
| 3      | 30% Discount|

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT SaleDetail
FROM Sales
WHERE SaleDetail LIKE '%50\%%' ESCAPE '\';
```
**Explanation**: Escapes the `%` wildcard to search for the literal string "50%."

**Result**:
| SaleDetail |
|------------|
| 50% Off    |

---

### **6. Combining Wildcards with Logical Operators**

Wildcards can be combined with logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

#### **Example 1: Names Containing "i" but Not Ending with "e"**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE '%i%' AND Name NOT LIKE '%e';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names containing "i" but excludes those ending with "e."

**Result**:
| Name      |
|-----------|
| Diana     |

---

#### **Example 2: Names Starting with "C" or Ending with "a"**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE 'C%' OR Name LIKE '%a';
```
**Explanation**: Matches names starting with "C" or ending with "a."

**Result**:
| Name      |
|-----------|
| Charlie   |
| Diana     |

---

### **Best Practices for Using Wildcards**

1. **Optimize Wildcard Usage**:
   - Avoid starting patterns with `%` as it can significantly slow down query performance. For example, `Name LIKE '%Smith'` is less efficient than `Name LIKE 'Smith%'`.

2. **Use `ESCAPE` When Necessary**:
   - Use the `ESCAPE` keyword to search for literal wildcard characters.

3. **Combine with Other Filters**:
   - Use wildcards in conjunction with additional conditions (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) for more precise queries.

4. **Test and Debug**:
   - Validate patterns using test data to ensure accuracy.

5. **Avoid Overuse**:
   - Use wildcards judiciously, especially with large datasets, to prevent performance issues.

### **Conclusion**

SQL wildcards are indispensable for performing flexible pattern matching in string data. Whether you need to find partial matches, filter out specific records, or search for literal wildcard characters, wildcards like `%`, `_`, `[]`, and `[^]` simplify complex queries. By practicing the examples and following best practices, you can efficiently query databases and handle diverse data challenges.
