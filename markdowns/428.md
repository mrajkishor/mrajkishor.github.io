# 💅 Styled Components and Emotion in Next.js — Writing CSS with JavaScript Superpowers

In the modern web world, developers crave modularity, maintainability, and reusability. Enter **CSS-in-JS**, a technique that allows you to write CSS directly inside your JavaScript files. Two of the most popular libraries leading this movement are **Styled Components** and **Emotion** — and both work beautifully with Next.js.

This blog covers **how to use Styled Components and Emotion**, their pros and cons, and how to set them up for **server-side rendering (SSR)** in Next.js.

## 🧠 What is CSS-in-JS?

**CSS-in-JS** is a styling approach where CSS is written inside JS/TS files using tagged template literals or object syntax. Styles are scoped to components by default and allow for:
- Dynamic styling
- Theming support
- Zero global collisions
- Complete style encapsulation

## 💅 Styled Components — Overview

[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) is a CSS-in-JS library built for React. It lets you create **styled elements** by defining styled components using tagged template literals.

### ✅ Installation

```bash
npm install styled-components
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-styled-components
```

### ✅ Next.js Configuration (SSR Support)

Update `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  compiler: {
    styledComponents: true,
  },
};
```

Or, use a [custom `_document.js`](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#nextjs) for advanced SSR support if required.

---

### 📦 Usage

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: royalblue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
`;

export default function Home() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
}
```

✅ Styles are scoped  
✅ Supports dynamic props  
✅ Can be themed with `ThemeProvider`

---

## 💖 Emotion — Overview

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) is another powerful CSS-in-JS library for React, offering two syntaxes:

- **`@emotion/styled`**: Styled Components–like API
- **`@emotion/react`**: CSS prop and object styles

### ✅ Installation

```bash
npm install @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

---

### 📦 Usage (Styled API)

```js
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

const Card = styled.div`
  padding: 20px;
  background: #f1f1f1;
  border-radius: 10px;
`;

export default function App() {
  return <Card>This is a card</Card>;
}
```

---

### 📦 Usage (CSS Prop API)

```js
/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */
import { css } from '@emotion/react';

const style = css`
  font-size: 24px;
  color: teal;
`;

export default function Title() {
  return <h1 css={style}>Emotion with CSS Prop</h1>;
}
```

To use the `css` prop, you must enable the Babel plugin or use the `/** @jsxImportSource */` comment.

---

## 🎨 Theming with Both Libraries

Both libraries support **theming** via a `ThemeProvider`.

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'royalblue',
  },
};

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

And in your styled component:

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.primary};
`;
```

Emotion offers the same via `@emotion/react`.
