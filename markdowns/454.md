# 🚀 AWS Lambda Hands-On Guide

Serverless computing has revolutionized how developers build and deploy applications. **AWS Lambda** stands at the forefront of this change, enabling you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. In this hands-on guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to get started with AWS Lambda—from concepts to real-world execution.

---

## 🧠 What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)** provided by Amazon Web Services. It lets you run code in response to events such as HTTP requests, file uploads to S3, changes in DynamoDB tables, and more.

- **No server management** – AWS handles all the infrastructure.
- **Auto-scaling** – Scales precisely with the number of events.
- **Pay-as-you-go** – You are charged only for execution time.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before jumping in, make sure you have:

- An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- AWS CLI installed and configured:  
  `aws configure`
- Basic knowledge of Node.js, Python, or Java
- Optional: AWS SAM CLI or Serverless Framework for advanced deployment

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Creating Your First Lambda Function

### 📌 Step 1: Open AWS Lambda Console

Go to [Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/) → Click **"Create Function"** → Choose **Author from scratch**

### 📌 Step 2: Configure Your Function

- **Function name**: `HelloLambda`
- **Runtime**: Choose your language (e.g., Node.js 18.x, Python 3.10, Java 17)
- **Execution Role**: Choose "Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions"

Click **Create Function**

---

## ✍️ Step 3: Write Your Code

For example, in **Node.js**, update your Lambda function code:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    console.log("Event:", event);
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify("Hello from Lambda!"),
    };
};
```

Click **Deploy**

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Test Your Function

Click **Test** → Configure test event (leave default or add JSON input) → Click **Test**

You should see `Hello from Lambda!` in the response.

---

## 🔁 Trigger Lambda with Events

Lambda can be triggered by:

- **API Gateway** (REST/HTTP endpoint)
- **S3** (e.g., file uploads)
- **DynamoDB Streams**
- **CloudWatch Events or Logs**
- **SNS/SQS**
- **EventBridge**

### Example: Connect with API Gateway

1. Go to API Gateway → Create API → HTTP API
2. Choose Lambda Integration → Select your Lambda function
3. Deploy the API and get a public URL

You now have a serverless REST API!

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Case: Image Compression

**Problem:** Automatically compress images uploaded to an S3 bucket.

**Workflow:**

- Upload to `raw-images` bucket
- Lambda is triggered → compresses the image
- Saves result to `compressed-images` bucket

**Technologies Used:**  
Lambda, S3 trigger, Node.js with Sharp library

---

## 📦 Deploy with AWS SAM (Optional)

If you're deploying via code:

### 1. Install SAM CLI:  
```bash
brew install aws/tap/aws-sam-cli
```

### 2. Create Template:
```yaml
# template.yaml
Resources:
  HelloLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      CodeUri: .
      Handler: app.handler
      Runtime: nodejs18.x
      Events:
        HelloWorld:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```

### 3. Deploy:
```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

## 📊 Monitoring Lambda

Use **CloudWatch Logs** and **AWS X-Ray** to monitor:

- Invocation count
- Execution duration
- Errors and timeouts
- Cold starts

---

## 💰 AWS Lambda Pricing

You are billed for:

- **Number of requests**
- **Duration (in milliseconds)** based on memory size
- **Free tier**: 1M requests and 400,000 GB-seconds per month

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use environment variables
- Package dependencies carefully
- Enable versioning and aliases
- Secure with least privilege IAM policies
- Avoid long cold starts (use provisioned concurrency if needed)

---

## 🧪 Try More Projects

- REST API for a TODO app
- Chatbot using Lambda + Lex
- Email sender using SES + Lambda
- Cron jobs using CloudWatch Events
- ETL pipeline using S3 → Lambda → DynamoDB

## 📚 Conclusion

AWS Lambda allows you to build **scalable, cost-efficient, and production-ready** applications without managing any servers. It’s an essential tool in the modern cloud-native developer’s toolbox.

Whether you're just getting started or already deploying large-scale apps, mastering AWS Lambda opens the door to powerful, event-driven architectures.
