### **Understanding Data Manipulation Language (DML) in SQL**

Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL commands that focuses on managing and manipulating data within database tables. These commands enable users to insert, retrieve, update, and delete data. Unlike DDL commands that deal with the structure of a database, DML is all about interacting with the data itself.

In this blog, weâ€™ll explore DML commands in detail with practical examples.

---

## **Key DML Commands**
1. **SELECT**: Retrieve data from a table.
2. **INSERT**: Add new rows to a table.
3. **UPDATE**: Modify existing data in a table.
4. **DELETE**: Remove specific rows from a table.

### **1. SELECT Command**
The `SELECT` command is used to retrieve data from one or more tables. It can include filters, conditions, and sorting.

#### **Basic Example**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```
This retrieves all columns and rows from the `Employees` table.

#### **With Conditions**
```sql
SELECT Name, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Engineering';
```
This retrieves the `Name` and `Salary` of employees from the `Engineering` department.

#### **With Sorting**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```
This retrieves all employee data, sorted by salary in descending order.

#### **With Aggregate Functions**
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;
```
This calculates the number of employees in each department.

### **2. INSERT Command**
The `INSERT` command is used to add new rows of data to a table.

#### **Basic Example**
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Engineering', 75000.00);
```
This inserts a new row into the `Employees` table.

#### **Insert Multiple Rows**
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary)
VALUES 
(2, 'Bob', 'HR', 50000.00),
(3, 'Charlie', 'Finance', 60000.00);
```
This adds two rows to the `Employees` table.

#### **Insert Data from Another Table**
```sql
INSERT INTO HighSalaryEmployees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary)
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 70000;
```
This inserts data into `HighSalaryEmployees` from the `Employees` table based on a condition.

---

### **3. UPDATE Command**
The `UPDATE` command modifies existing rows in a table.

#### **Basic Example**
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 80000.00
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```
This updates the salary of the employee with `EmployeeID = 1`.

#### **Update Multiple Columns**
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 90000.00, Department = 'Engineering'
WHERE Name = 'Bob';
```
This updates both the `Salary` and `Department` for `Bob`.

#### **Update All Rows**
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = Salary * 1.10;
```
This increases the salary of all employees by 10%.

---

### **4. DELETE Command**
The `DELETE` command removes specific rows from a table.

#### **Basic Example**
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```
This deletes the row where `EmployeeID` equals 1.

#### **Delete Rows Based on a Condition**
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Salary < 50000;
```
This removes all employees earning less than 50,000.

#### **Delete All Rows**
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees;
```
This deletes all rows from the `Employees` table but keeps the table structure intact.

---

### **Transaction Management with DML**
DML operations are often used in conjunction with Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands like `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT` to ensure data integrity.

#### **Example: Using Transactions**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary)
VALUES (4, 'Diana', 'Marketing', 55000.00);

UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 60000.00
WHERE Name = 'Diana';

-- If there's an error or rollback is required
ROLLBACK;

-- If everything is correct
COMMIT;
```

### **DML in Practice**

#### **Scenario: Managing Employee Data**
1. **Insert New Employees**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary)
   VALUES 
   (5, 'Eve', 'Sales', 65000.00),
   (6, 'Frank', 'Engineering', 85000.00);
   ```

2. **Retrieve Data**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Engineering';
   ```

3. **Update Employee Details**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE Employees
   SET Department = 'Product Management', Salary = 95000.00
   WHERE Name = 'Frank';
   ```

4. **Delete Low-Salary Employees**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Salary < 50000;
   ```

### **Key Differences Between DML and Other SQL Categories**

| Feature               | DML                         | DDL                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Manipulates data            | Manages database structure  |
| **Commands**          | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE |
| **Transaction Control** | Requires `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` | Automatically committed     |
| **Impact**            | Changes table content       | Changes table schema        |

### **Conclusion**
Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands are the backbone of SQL operations, allowing users to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data efficiently. These commands ensure seamless interaction with data while maintaining its integrity. By mastering DML, you can handle all core data operations in a relational database, making it a critical skill for database developers and administrators alike.
