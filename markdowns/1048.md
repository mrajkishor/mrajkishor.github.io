### DFS (Only for Trees/Acyclic Graphs)

## üîç What is the DFS-based Shortest Path?

**Depth-First Search (DFS)** is a traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. While **not optimal for shortest path in general graphs**, it **can** be used to compute the shortest path in:

* **Trees** (i.e., connected, acyclic graphs)
* **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** with uniform edge weights (or implicit weights of 1)

## ‚úÖ When is DFS Valid for Shortest Path?

| Scenario                     | DFS Usable for Shortest Path? | Why?                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Tree (Unweighted)**        | ‚úÖ Yes                         | No cycles, unique path between nodes  |
| **DAG with uniform weights** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes                  | Can work if used with proper tracking |
| **Cyclic or weighted graph** | ‚ùå No                          | DFS does not guarantee minimal path   |

## üìö Core Idea

In **trees**, DFS can be used to traverse from a **source node** and keep track of the **distance** from the source to all other nodes. Since there's only **one path** between any two nodes in a tree, DFS will always return the correct shortest path.

## üß† DFS-Based Shortest Path (for Trees) ‚Äî Algorithm

```python
def dfs(node, parent, distance):
    dist[node] = distance
    for neighbor in adj[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            dfs(neighbor, node, distance + 1)
```

* `node`: current vertex
* `parent`: parent to avoid revisiting
* `distance`: number of edges from source
* `adj`: adjacency list
* `dist`: stores shortest distances from source

## üß™ Example

### Tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /     \
    4       5
```

### Adjacency List:

```python
adj = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [1, 4],
    3: [1, 5],
    4: [2],
    5: [3]
}
```

### Output from DFS starting at node `1`:

```
dist = {
    1: 0,
    2: 1,
    3: 1,
    4: 2,
    5: 2
}
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Measure              | Value                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Time Complexity**  | `O(N)` where N = number of nodes                 |
| **Space Complexity** | `O(N)` due to recursion stack and distance array |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of DFS for Shortest Path

* **Cycles**: DFS can get trapped or revisit nodes ‚Üí needs visited tracking
* **Multiple Paths**: DFS doesn't always find the *minimum* path unless you explicitly track all possible paths
* **Weighted Graphs**: DFS does not consider edge weights ‚Äî fails to optimize for cost

## üß© Summary

* DFS **is valid for shortest path only** when the graph is a **tree or acyclic and unweighted**.
* Use DFS to assign distance from source using recursive depth tracking.
* **For general graphs**, especially with multiple paths or weights, **BFS or Dijkstra** should be used.
* Be prepared for **code-based DFS questions** and **edge-case reasoning** in GATE.
