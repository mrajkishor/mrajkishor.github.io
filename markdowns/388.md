# 🔐 AWS KMS Hands-On with AWS CLI: Encrypt, Decrypt, and Manage Your Keys

When building secure applications on AWS, **data encryption is non-negotiable**. Whether you're storing secrets, S3 objects, database records, or application configs, **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** allows you to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys securely.

In this hands-on guide, you'll learn how to:
- Create and manage KMS keys using AWS CLI
- Encrypt and decrypt data with KMS
- Manage key policies, aliases, and grants
- Use KMS with other services like S3 or Lambda

## 🧰 What is AWS KMS?

**AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create and control cryptographic keys and use them to encrypt data across AWS services and custom applications.

### 🔐 Key Features:
- Create **symmetric** and **asymmetric** keys
- Integrated with 100+ AWS services
- Supports **automatic key rotation**
- Granular access via **IAM policies**, **key policies**, and **grants**
- **FIPS 140-2** validated hardware security modules (HSMs)

> **Note** : FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 140-2 is the benchmark for validating the effectiveness of cryptographic hardware. If a product has a FIPS 140-2 certificate you know that it has been tested and formally validated by the U.S. and Canadian Governments.

## 🚀 Getting Started with KMS via AWS CLI

### ✅ Prerequisites:
- AWS CLI installed and configured (`aws configure`)
- IAM user/role with access to:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "kms:*"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

---

## 🔑 Step 1: Create a Customer Managed Key (CMK)

```bash
aws kms create-key --description "Key for encrypting secrets" --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT --origin AWS_KMS
```

📌 Response includes `KeyId` and `Arn` — save these for later.

---

## 🏷️ Step 2: Add an Alias (Human-Readable Key Name)

```bash
aws kms create-alias --alias-name alias/my-key --target-key-id <KeyId>
```

Now you can refer to the key using `alias/my-key` instead of the full ID.

---

## 🔐 Step 3: Encrypt a File or Text

### 3.1 Encrypt a simple plaintext string:
```bash
aws kms encrypt \
  --key-id alias/my-key \
  --plaintext "MySecretValue" \
  --output text \
  --query CiphertextBlob
```

> Returns a **base64-encoded** ciphertext string.

---

### 3.2 Encrypt a file:
```bash
aws kms encrypt \
  --key-id alias/my-key \
  --plaintext fileb://secret.txt \
  --output text \
  --query CiphertextBlob > secret.txt.encrypted
```

---

## 🔓 Step 4: Decrypt a Value

### 4.1 Decrypt base64 string:
```bash
aws kms decrypt \
  --ciphertext-blob fileb://secret.txt.encrypted \
  --output text \
  --query Plaintext | base64 --decode
```

🧠 **Note:** KMS requires base64 encoding when handling raw files and binary.

---

## 🔁 Step 5: Enable Key Rotation (Best Practice)

```bash
aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id alias/my-key
```

AWS will rotate the key **automatically every year**.

---

## 🚫 Step 6: Disable or Schedule Key Deletion

### Temporarily disable a key:
```bash
aws kms disable-key --key-id alias/my-key
```

### Schedule deletion:
```bash
aws kms schedule-key-deletion --key-id alias/my-key --pending-window-in-days 7
```

---

## 🔧 Step 7: List and Describe Keys

```bash
aws kms list-keys
aws kms describe-key --key-id alias/my-key
aws kms list-aliases
```

---

## 🎯 Advanced: Use KMS Grants (Temporary Access for Roles)

Grants allow a **specific AWS service, IAM user, or role** to use the key without changing the key policy.

```bash
aws kms create-grant \
  --key-id alias/my-key \
  --grantee-principal arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyLambdaRole \
  --operations Encrypt Decrypt
```

## 🧠 Use Cases of KMS with AWS CLI

| Service     | Use KMS for…                           |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| **SSM**     | Encrypt secrets with SecureString      |
| **S3**      | Bucket-level or object-level encryption|
| **Lambda**  | Decrypt config at runtime              |
| **EBS / RDS** | Encrypt volumes or backups            |
| **DynamoDB**| Encrypt data at rest                   |

---

## 🛡️ Best Practices

| Practice                     | Why It Matters                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Use **aliases**             | Easier to manage than raw key IDs          |
| Enable **automatic rotation** | Regularly updates key material           |
| Apply **least privilege**   | Fine-grained IAM or key policy controls    |
| **Audit with CloudTrail**   | Track key usage and access attempts        |
| Never hardcode key IDs      | Use environment variables or aliases       |

---

## 🧪 Sample Real-World Shell Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
PLAINTEXT="SecretMessage123"
KEY_ALIAS="alias/my-key"

# Encrypt
ENCRYPTED=$(aws kms encrypt --key-id $KEY_ALIAS --plaintext "$PLAINTEXT" --output text --query CiphertextBlob)

echo "Encrypted: $ENCRYPTED"

# Decrypt
DECRYPTED=$(aws kms decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://<(echo $ENCRYPTED | base64 --decode) --output text --query Plaintext | base64 --decode)

echo "Decrypted: $DECRYPTED"
```

## 🧾 Conclusion

Using **AWS KMS with the CLI** gives you direct, scriptable access to encryption workflows. It’s the foundation for building secure-by-default applications and managing sensitive data across your infrastructure.

Whether you’re storing secrets in Parameter Store, securing S3 buckets, or encrypting local files, **KMS + CLI** gives you the flexibility and control you need — with enterprise-grade security behind the scenes.
