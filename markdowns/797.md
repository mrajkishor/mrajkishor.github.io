---

## ‚úÖ **7.1 Point-to-Point Networks**

A **Point-to-Point (P2P) Network** is a simple and direct type of network topology where **exactly two nodes** (devices or endpoints) are connected via a **dedicated communication link**.

### üîó Characteristics:

* **Direct communication** between the two devices
* No intermediate devices like routers or switches involved
* Can be **wired** (copper, fiber) or **wireless** (microwave, radio)

---

### üì° Examples:

* Leased lines between branch offices
* VPN tunnels between client and server
* Dedicated links between two routers

---

### üõ† Technologies Used:

* **HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)**
* **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)**
* **SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol)**

---

### ‚úÖ Advantages:

| Benefit            | Description                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security**       | Only two endpoints involved ‚Äî no data leakage risk |
| **Low Latency**    | No intermediate hops, so transmission is faster    |
| **High Bandwidth** | Dedicated bandwidth between endpoints              |
| **Reliability**    | Fewer chances of congestion or link failure        |

---

### ‚ùå Limitations:

* **Not scalable** for more than two devices
* **Requires dedicated infrastructure** (expensive for large networks)
* **Not suitable for dynamic or many-to-many communication**

---

## ‚úÖ **7.2 Routing**

**Routing** is the process of determining the **optimal path** for data packets to travel from source to destination across a network.

---

### üß† Core Components:

| Component              | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing Tables**     | Stores next-hop, destination networks, and metrics              |
| **Routing Algorithms** | Decide best path using metrics like hop count, delay, bandwidth |
| **Routing Protocols**  | Exchange routing info between routers (e.g., RIP, OSPF, BGP)    |

---

### üîÅ Types of Routing:

| Type                | Description                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static Routing**  | Manually configured, doesn't adapt automatically                       |
| **Dynamic Routing** | Automatically updates based on network changes using routing protocols |

---

### üì¶ Common Routing Protocols:

| Protocol | Type                 | Use                    |
| -------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **RIP**  | IGP, Distance Vector | Small networks         |
| **OSPF** | IGP, Link State      | Enterprise networks    |
| **BGP**  | EGP                  | Internet-level routing |

---

### üßæ Benefits of Routing:

* Ensures **efficient packet delivery**
* Enables **inter-network communication**
* Supports **load balancing and fault tolerance**

---

## ‚úÖ **7.3 Congestion Control**

**Congestion control** refers to the **regulation of network traffic** to prevent overload, packet loss, and performance degradation.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Causes Congestion?

* Too many packets trying to use the same resource (link/buffer)
* Slow receivers
* Network hardware limits

---

### üß∞ Techniques Used:

| Technique                        | Description                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Traffic Monitoring**           | Measures RTT, packet loss, and queue length to detect congestion                |
| **Congestion Detection**         | Uses buffer levels or arrival rates to identify early signs                     |
| **Traffic Shaping & Policing**   | Delays or discards excess packets to regulate flow                              |
| **Proactive Control (RED, AQM)** | Random Early Detection drops some packets before congestion occurs              |
| **Reactive Control (TCP)**       | TCP uses window adjustment based on feedback (ACKs/loss) to adapt to congestion |

---

### üéØ Objectives:

* Ensure **fairness** among users
* Maintain **high throughput** and **low delay**
* Prevent packet loss and retransmission overhead
* Sustain **Quality of Service (QoS)** in the network

---

### üìà Examples:

* **TCP Reno/NewReno**: Uses slow-start, congestion avoidance
* **RED (Random Early Detection)**: Probabilistically drops packets before queue is full
* **Leaky Bucket & Token Bucket**: Rate-based traffic control mechanisms
