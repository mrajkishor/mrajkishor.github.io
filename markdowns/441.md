## 📘 Normal Forms (CNF and DNF)

In propositional logic, **Normal Forms** are standardized ways of expressing logical formulas using combinations of basic operators.  
The two most common forms are:

- **CNF** – Conjunctive Normal Form  
- **DNF** – Disjunctive Normal Form

---

### 🔹 Why Use Normal Forms?

- ✅ For simplifying logical expressions
- ✅ To standardize inputs for algorithms (e.g., SAT solvers)
- ✅ Useful in digital logic design, compiler design, and AI

## 🧱 1. **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**

### ▶️ Structure:
A formula is in **CNF** if it is a **conjunction (AND)** of one or more **clauses**,  
and each clause is a **disjunction (OR)** of **literals**.

📌 *Literals = atomic propositions or their negations (like P, ¬Q)*

### 📐 General Format:
```
(P ∨ Q) ∧ (¬R ∨ S) ∧ (T)
```

Each clause: `(...)` uses **OR**  
Whole expression: ==clauses== joined with **AND**

---

### ✅ Example:
Expression:  
```
(P ∨ Q) ∧ (¬Q ∨ R)
```

Already in CNF — two OR clauses combined with AND

---

### 🔧 Steps to Convert to CNF:
1. **Eliminate implications**:  
   `P → Q` becomes `¬P ∨ Q`
2. **Move NOTs inward** using De Morgan's Laws
3. **Distribute ∨ over ∧** to match CNF format  
   Example:  
   ```
   P ∨ (Q ∧ R) → (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)
   ```

## 🧱 2. **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**

### ▶️ Structure:
A formula is in **DNF** if it is a **disjunction (OR)** of one or more **terms**,  
and each term is a **conjunction (AND)** of **literals**.

### 📐 General Format:
```
(P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬R ∧ S) ∨ (T)
```

Each term: `(...)` uses **AND**  
Whole expression: ==terms== joined with **OR**

---

### ✅ Example:
Expression:  
```
(P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬P ∧ R)
```

This is in DNF

---

### 🔧 Steps to Convert to DNF:
1. Eliminate implications and equivalences
2. Apply De Morgan's laws to simplify negations
3. Distribute **AND** over **OR**

🧠 Example:
```
P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)
```

## 🔄 CNF vs DNF Comparison

| Feature           | CNF                              | DNF                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Structure         | AND of ORs (clauses)             | OR of ANDs (terms)              |
| Use Case          | SAT Solvers, Resolution          | Pattern Matching, Rule Engines  |
| Example           | (P ∨ Q) ∧ (¬R ∨ S)               | (P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬R ∧ S)              |
