## üìò Data Preprocessing Techniques ‚Äì Making Data Ready for Analysis

---

### üîπ What is Data Preprocessing?

**Data preprocessing** is the process of transforming raw data into a clean, consistent, and analysis-ready format. In the context of **data warehousing**, it ensures that the data loaded into the warehouse is:

* Accurate
* Reliable
* Consistent
* Scalable for analysis and mining

> üìå ‚ÄúGarbage in, garbage out‚Äù ‚Äî preprocessing helps avoid that in data systems.

---

### üîπ Why is Preprocessing Needed?

Real-world data is often:

* Incomplete (missing values)
* Noisy (errors, outliers)
* Inconsistent (different formats or conflicting data)
* Redundant (duplicated values)

To ensure meaningful analytics or machine learning, **preprocessing is a must**.

## üî∑ Main Data Preprocessing Techniques

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Data Cleaning**

Removes:

* **Missing values**
* **Noisy data**
* **Duplicate entries**
* **Inconsistent formats**

#### Techniques:

* Fill missing values (mean/median/mode imputation)
* Drop rows/columns with too many missing fields
* Use regression or model-based imputation
* Detect outliers using statistical methods

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Data Integration**

Combines data from multiple sources into a **coherent data store**

#### Challenges:

* Schema mismatch (e.g., `Emp_ID` in one source, `EmployeeID` in another)
* Redundant records
* Inconsistent data formats

#### Techniques:

* **Schema matching**
* **Entity resolution**
* **Conflict detection and resolution**

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Data Transformation**

Converts data into appropriate format or structure

#### Common operations:

* **Normalization**: Scale values to a uniform range (e.g., \[0,1])
* **Standardization**: Center data around mean with unit variance
* **Discretization**: Convert continuous values to discrete bins
* **Encoding**: Convert categories to numerical (e.g., one-hot encoding)

#### Example:

```text
Salary: ‚Çπ35,000 ‚Üí Normalized to 0.35 if max is ‚Çπ1,00,000
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Data Reduction**

Reduces the volume but keeps the essential structure

#### Techniques:

* Dimensionality reduction (e.g., **PCA**)
* Data cube aggregation
* Sampling
* Binning

> ‚úÖ Helps in improving computation time and model generalization

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Data Discretization**

Transforms numeric data into categorical form (bins or intervals)

#### Methods:

* Equal-width binning
* Equal-frequency binning
* Entropy-based binning

#### Example:

```text
Age  ‚Üí [0‚Äì18] = Child, [19‚Äì60] = Adult, 60+ = Senior
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Data Sampling**

Selects a subset of data when the full dataset is too large to process

#### Types:

* Simple random sampling
* Stratified sampling
* Systematic sampling

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **Data Normalization**

Scaling features so they contribute equally:

* **Min-Max normalization**: Scales to \[0,1]
* **Z-score normalization**: Uses mean and standard deviation

```text
Z = (x ‚Äì Œº) / œÉ
```

> GATE may ask which normalization is used when **mean = 0, std. dev = 1**



### ‚úÖ 8. **Data Compression** 

Reduces data size to save storage and improve processing time.

#### Techniques:

* **Lossless Compression**: No data is lost
  ‚Üí e.g., Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Huffman Coding
* **Lossy Compression**: Some precision is lost (used in images/audio)
  ‚Üí Not used in structured data

> In data warehouses, **lossless compression** (like RLE in columnar stores) is common for optimizing space.
