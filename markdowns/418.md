Routing is an essential part of every web application. While traditional React apps require **manual setup of routes using React Router**, **Next.js revolutionizes this with a file-based routing system** that is **automatic, intuitive, and powerful**.

In this blog, you’ll learn how Next.js handles routing through its filesystem, and how you can build dynamic, nested, and catch-all routes effortlessly.

## 🧠 What is File-Based Routing?

In Next.js, **every file inside the `pages/` directory automatically becomes a route**.

> You don’t need to manually configure a router – Next.js maps the file path directly to the URL.

---

## 📦 Example Structure and Routes

```
/pages
  ├── index.js            →  /
  ├── about.js            →  /about
  └── blog
        ├── index.js      →  /blog
        └── post.js       →  /blog/post
```

---

## 🏠 Default Page: `pages/index.js`

The `index.js` file inside the `pages/` folder represents the **home page (`/`)** of your application.

```js
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Welcome to the homepage</h1>;
}
```

---

## 📄 Static Pages

Every `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file inside `pages/` becomes its **own route**.

```js
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Us</h1>;
}
```

Visit `/about` in the browser — no router setup needed!

---

## 🧩 Nested Routes (Folders as Paths)

Create folders inside `pages/` to create **nested routes**.

```bash
/pages/products/shirts.js  →  /products/shirts
/pages/blog/post.js        →  /blog/post
```

This is perfect for organizing your app into sections.

---

## 🔁 Dynamic Routing: `[param].js`

Use **square brackets** to create dynamic routes.

```bash
/pages/blog/[slug].js  →  /blog/hello-world
```

```js
// pages/blog/[slug].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;
  return <h1>Post: {slug}</h1>;
}
```

Now, `/blog/anything` will render this page.

---

## 🔢 Multiple Parameters: `[id]/[comment].js`

```bash
/pages/products/[id]/[review].js → /products/42/review123
```

Next.js captures both `id` and `review` from the URL.

---

## 📦 Catch-All Routes: `[...params].js`

To match **multiple dynamic segments**, use the **rest parameter** syntax.

```bash
/pages/docs/[...slug].js
```

This will match:
- `/docs/a`
- `/docs/a/b`
- `/docs/a/b/c`

```js
// pages/docs/[...slug].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Docs() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(slug)}</pre>;
}
```

---

## 📁 Index Files in Folders

Each folder can have an `index.js` that represents the **base route** of that path.

```bash
/pages/products/index.js → /products
```

---

## 📜 Special Files

| File                | Purpose                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| `pages/_app.js`     | Custom App component (layout wrapper) |
| `pages/_document.js`| Customize HTML document structure     |
| `pages/404.js`      | Custom 404 page               |
| `pages/api/`        | API route definitions (not frontend) |

---

## 🌐 Link Navigation with `next/link`

Use `next/link` to navigate between pages **without reloading the page**.

```js
import Link from 'next/link';

<Link href="/about">About</Link>
```

This enables **client-side routing** with **preloading** and seamless transitions.

---

## 🚫 What You Don’t Need to Do

- ❌ No need to define a route table
- ❌ No need for `react-router-dom`
- ❌ No manual config for nested or dynamic routes

## ✅ Summary

| Feature            | Description                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| File-based Routing | Pages auto-mapped from `pages/` folder structure   |
| Nested Routes      | Created via folder hierarchy                       |
| Dynamic Routes     | Use `[param].js`                                   |
| Catch-all Routes   | Use `[...param].js`                                |
| Seamless Nav       | Use `next/link` for internal navigation            |

Next.js file-based routing is **minimal, automatic, and powerful** — perfect for rapidly building scalable and organized applications.
