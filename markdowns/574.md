# 🧭 Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS)

When solving **shortest path problems in unweighted graphs**, one of the most efficient and intuitive algorithms to use is **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. This method ensures the shortest path (minimum number of edges) from a source node to all reachable nodes in a graph.

---

## 📌 Why BFS Works for Unweighted Graphs

In an **unweighted graph**, all edges are treated equally — meaning the cost of moving from one node to another is constant (say 1). BFS explores nodes level-by-level: it visits all neighbors of a node before moving deeper. This property naturally yields the shortest path in terms of edge count.

---

## 🧠 Key Idea

- **BFS visits nodes in order of increasing distance** from the source.
- The **first time** a node is visited via BFS is always through the **shortest path** from the source.

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- Finding minimum number of hops between two nodes (e.g., social network degree of connection).
- Solving puzzles like word ladder, sliding puzzles, shortest transformation sequences.
- Route planning on road networks (if all roads are of equal length).

---

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)` — where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(V)` — for visited set and queue.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Steps

```text
1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the source node.
2. Maintain a visited set to track visited nodes.
3. Maintain a distance map to record the shortest distance to each node.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the front node.
   b. For each unvisited neighbor:
      - Mark as visited
      - Record distance as distance[current] + 1
      - Enqueue the neighbor
```

## 👨‍💻 Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class UnweightedShortestPath {

    public static Map<Integer, Integer> bfsShortestPaths(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int source) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> distance = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();

        queue.offer(source);
        visited.add(source);
        distance.put(source, 0);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int current = queue.poll();
            for (int neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(current, new ArrayList<>())) {
                if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                    visited.add(neighbor);
                    distance.put(neighbor, distance.get(current) + 1);
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        return distance;
    }
}
```



Here is the **full runnable Java program** for the `UnweightedShortestPath` using BFS to find the shortest paths in an unweighted graph:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class UnweightedShortestPath {

    // Function to compute shortest path using BFS
    public static Map<Integer, Integer> bfsShortestPaths(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int source) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> distance = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();

        queue.offer(source);
        visited.add(source);
        distance.put(source, 0);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int current = queue.poll();
            for (int neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(current, new ArrayList<>())) {
                if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                    visited.add(neighbor);
                    distance.put(neighbor, distance.get(current) + 1);
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        return distance;
    }

    // Main function with example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sample unweighted graph (undirected)
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        graph.put(0, Arrays.asList(1, 2));
        graph.put(1, Arrays.asList(0, 3, 4));
        graph.put(2, Arrays.asList(0, 4));
        graph.put(3, Arrays.asList(1, 5));
        graph.put(4, Arrays.asList(1, 2, 5));
        graph.put(5, Arrays.asList(3, 4));

        int source = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> shortestDistances = bfsShortestPaths(graph, source);

        System.out.println("Shortest distances from source node " + source + ":");
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : shortestDistances.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println("Node " + entry.getKey() + " -> Distance: " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output (for the above sample graph):

```
Shortest distances from source node 0:
Node 0 -> Distance: 0
Node 1 -> Distance: 1
Node 2 -> Distance: 1
Node 3 -> Distance: 2
Node 4 -> Distance: 2
Node 5 -> Distance: 3
```

## 🧪 Example

### Graph:
```
0 - 1 - 2
|   |
3 - 4
```

### BFS from node `0`:
- Distance Map: `{0=0, 1=1, 3=1, 2=2, 4=2}`

## 🧩 Tips for Interviews

- Always clarify if the graph is **unweighted** and **undirected or directed**.
- Ask if you’re required to return:
  - Only the shortest distance
  - Or the actual path (then you'll need to track parents)
- Use BFS for **shortest steps**; use **Dijkstra’s** only when weights vary.

---

## 🔁 Path Reconstruction (Optional)

If you want to **reconstruct the actual path**, maintain a `Map<Node, Parent>` and backtrack from the destination.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **BFS is optimal** for shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
- It's simple, efficient, and easy to implement.
- Ideal for grid-based pathfinding, transformation problems, and basic routing.

> “In unweighted worlds, BFS is the king of shortest paths.” 👑

Let BFS be your default tool whenever weights are equal — it's fast, clean, and interview-friendly.
