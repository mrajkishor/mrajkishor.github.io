---

## üîç **Objective**

This section compares the **time and space complexities** of various **Shortest Path Algorithms** covered under both **GATE syllabus** and **advanced use-cases**. The goal is to understand their efficiency, trade-offs, and when to use which algorithm based on the graph's nature (unweighted, weighted, sparse, dense, cyclic, etc.).

## üß™ GATE Exam Tips

* Time complexity of Floyd‚ÄìWarshall and Johnson‚Äôs is frequently asked.
* Always clarify if the graph has:

  * Negative weights?
  * Directed or Undirected edges?
  * Dense vs Sparse structure?
* Be ready with formulae for edge cases like DAG (topo sort) and unreachable nodes.
