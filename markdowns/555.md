## 🚀 Introduction to Express.js

### 📌 What is Express.js?

**Express.js** is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for **Node.js**, used to build web applications and RESTful APIs with ease. It abstracts away much of the complexity of HTTP server handling, making backend development simpler and more productive.

It is often referred to as the **de facto standard server framework** for Node.js.

### 🧱 Why Use Express.js?

* ✅ **Minimal and flexible** – You build your stack the way you want.
* ✅ **Middleware support** – Powerful request processing pipeline.
* ✅ **Route handling** – Built-in and powerful routing API.
* ✅ **Scalable** – Suitable for both small apps and large-scale enterprise APIs.
* ✅ **Active ecosystem** – Tons of compatible middleware, tools, and integrations.

### 🧩 Core Features

| Feature                | Description                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚦 Routing             | HTTP verb-based routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)  |
| 🧱 Middleware          | Functions executed sequentially during request handling |
| 📦 Static File Serving | Serve HTML, CSS, JS, or image assets from directories   |
| 🛡️ Error Handling     | Centralized or custom error handlers                    |
| 🔐 Integration         | Works seamlessly with JWT, Passport, Mongoose, etc.     |

### 📚 Basic Example

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse JSON
app.use(express.json());

// Simple GET route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World from Express!');
});

// POST route
app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ received: req.body });
});

// Start server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

---

### 🔄 Middleware in Express

Middleware functions have access to:

* `req` (request)
* `res` (response)
* `next()` (to pass control to the next middleware)

Example:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request made to: ${req.path}`);
  next();
});
```

---

### 🌐 Routing Example

```js
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID is ${req.params.id}`);
});
```

Supports:

* Route parameters
* Query strings (`req.query`)
* JSON body (`req.body` via `express.json()`)

---

### 🚧 Real-World Use Cases

* REST APIs for web/mobile apps
* Microservices backend
* Static file server
* Middleware pipelines (authentication, logging, etc.)

### 🧠 Conclusion

Express.js remains one of the most popular and beginner-friendly web frameworks in the Node.js ecosystem. Whether you're building a simple prototype or a production-grade API, Express provides the core building blocks with enough flexibility and power to scale with your needs.
