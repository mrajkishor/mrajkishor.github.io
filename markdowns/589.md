# 🔄 Transactions in MongoDB: A Complete Guide

MongoDB has long been recognized for its flexibility, scalability, and developer-friendly document model. But one major feature that elevated it to enterprise-grade database status is its support for **ACID transactions** — a game-changer for applications that need atomicity across multiple operations or documents.

In this post, we’ll explore what transactions are in MongoDB, how they work, when to use them, and best practices to avoid performance pitfalls.

## 🧠 What is a Transaction?

A **transaction** is a group of read and/or write operations that are executed **as a single atomic unit**. Either **all operations succeed**, or **none are applied** — ensuring **ACID** properties:

* **Atomicity** – all-or-nothing execution
* **Consistency** – data remains valid after the transaction
* **Isolation** – operations appear isolated from other clients
* **Durability** – committed changes persist even after failures

> ✅ In MongoDB, transactions ensure multiple documents or collections are **updated safely together**.

## 🔄 Single vs Multi-document Operations

MongoDB writes to **a single document are atomic by default**.

```js
db.accounts.updateOne(
  { _id: "123" },
  { $inc: { balance: -100 } }
)
```

This operation is already atomic.

But for **multi-document operations** — for example, transferring money between accounts — you’ll need transactions:

```js
session.startTransaction()
try {
  db.accounts.updateOne({ _id: "A" }, { $inc: { balance: -100 } }, { session })
  db.accounts.updateOne({ _id: "B" }, { $inc: { balance: 100 } }, { session })
  session.commitTransaction()
} catch (error) {
  session.abortTransaction()
}
```

## ⚙️ How to Use Transactions in MongoDB

MongoDB supports transactions in:

* **Replica sets** (since v4.0)
* **Sharded clusters** (since v4.2)

### 🔧 Basic Syntax with Node.js

```js
const session = client.startSession()

try {
  session.startTransaction()
  
  await users.updateOne({ _id: 1 }, { $set: { status: "active" } }, { session })
  await orders.insertOne({ userId: 1, item: "Book" }, { session })

  await session.commitTransaction()
} catch (err) {
  await session.abortTransaction()
  throw err
} finally {
  await session.endSession()
}
```

> 🧩 The same pattern applies in other drivers like Java, Python, and Go.

## 🔄 Retryable Writes vs Transactions

| Feature  | Retryable Write    | Multi-document Transaction        |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Scope    | Single operation   | Multiple operations               |
| ACID     | No                 | Yes                               |
| Use case | Idempotent inserts | Consistency across many documents |

## 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

* 🏦 **Banking systems**: debit one account, credit another
* 🛒 **E-commerce checkout**: create order, reduce inventory, log payment
* 📊 **Analytics**: write to multiple collections in sync
* 🏢 **ERP/CRM apps**: updating multiple user-related documents

## 🧱 Important Considerations

| Constraint  | Description                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance | Transactions are **slower** than single writes; use only when needed      |
| Duration    | Max transaction lifetime: **60 seconds**                                  |
| Size Limit  | 16MB document size per operation; \~1000 document changes recommended max |
| Locking     | Transactions hold locks — **can block other operations**                  |
| Sessions    | Transactions must be run inside an **active session**                     |
| Indexes     | Ensure involved collections are **indexed** for better performance        |

## 📊 Monitoring and Debugging

Use these tools to trace transactions:

* **MongoDB Atlas Performance Advisor**
* **MongoDB Profiler**:

```js
db.system.profile.find({ "command.startTransaction": { $exists: true } })
```

* **Mongo shell logs**:
  Check logs for `txnNumber`, `commitTransaction`, and `abortTransaction`

## ✅ Best Practices

| Best Practice                     | Why It Matters                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Keep transactions short           | Long transactions can lock resources |
| Use retries with backoff          | Transactions may fail on conflicts   |
| Prefer single-document operations | They are atomic and much faster      |
| Log failed/aborted transactions   | For debugging and recovery           |
| Use write concern `"majority"`    | To ensure durability on commit       |

## 🔚 Conclusion

MongoDB transactions bring **relational-style data safety** to NoSQL systems, allowing developers to confidently perform complex multi-document operations without risking data inconsistency. However, with great power comes responsibility: use transactions wisely and sparingly to maintain performance and scalability.

> 💡 **Rule of thumb**: Prefer single-document operations when possible, use transactions only when necessary.
