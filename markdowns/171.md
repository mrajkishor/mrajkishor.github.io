# **Hashing Techniques in File Organization**

Hashing is a widely used file organization technique in Database Management Systems (DBMS) that allows for **efficient retrieval** of records based on a key attribute. By applying a **hash function** to the key, hashing determines the location of a record in storage, enabling constant-time access for equality-based queries.

In this blog, we will explore hashing techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, and practical examples of how they are implemented in DBMS.

## **What is Hashing in File Organization?**

Hashing is a technique that maps a **key attribute** of a record to a specific location in a file using a mathematical function called a **hash function**. This mapping ensures that the record can be accessed directly without scanning the entire file.

### **Key Concepts in Hashing:**
1. **Key Attribute**:
   - The attribute used to identify a record, such as an employee ID or product code.
2. **Hash Function**:
   - A function that takes the key as input and generates a hash value, which determines the location of the record in storage.
3. **Buckets**:
   - The storage locations (or slots) where records are stored. A bucket can hold one or more records.
4. **Collision**:
   - Occurs when two different keys map to the same bucket.

## **Hashing Techniques**

### 1. **Static Hashing**
In static hashing, the hash function and the number of buckets remain fixed throughout the system's operation.

#### **How It Works:**
1. Apply the hash function to the key to determine the bucket.
2. Place the record in the corresponding bucket.

#### **Advantages:**
- Simple to implement.
- Efficient for fixed datasets with infrequent changes.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Limited scalability.
- Inefficient for dynamic datasets, leading to **overflow buckets** when a bucket becomes full.

#### **Example:**
- **Key Attribute**: EmployeeID
- **Hash Function**: `h(EmployeeID) = EmployeeID % 10`

If Employee IDs are `101, 202, 303`:
- `h(101) = 101 % 10 = 1` → Bucket 1
- `h(202) = 202 % 10 = 2` → Bucket 2
- `h(303) = 303 % 10 = 3` → Bucket 3

---

### 2. **Dynamic Hashing**
Dynamic hashing adapts to changes in the dataset by dynamically increasing or decreasing the number of buckets.

#### **How It Works:**
1. Starts with a small number of buckets.
2. Splits buckets as needed when collisions occur, ensuring scalability.

#### **Advantages:**
- Handles dynamic datasets efficiently.
- Reduces overflow buckets compared to static hashing.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- More complex implementation.
- Slightly higher overhead due to dynamic bucket management.

#### **Example: Extendible Hashing:**
- Uses a directory to map keys to buckets.
- Directory size doubles when buckets are split.

### 3. **Open Hashing (Separate Chaining)**
In open hashing, each bucket stores a **linked list** of records that hash to the same value. This technique resolves collisions by chaining multiple records to the same bucket.

#### **How It Works:**
1. Apply the hash function to determine the bucket.
2. If multiple records map to the same bucket, add them to the linked list in that bucket.

#### **Advantages:**
- Efficient for handling collisions.
- No limit on the number of records in a bucket.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Increased storage overhead for maintaining linked lists.
- Slower retrieval due to linear search within the list.

#### **Example:**
- **Hash Function**: `h(Key) = Key % 3`
- Buckets: `{0, 1, 2}`
- Keys: `12, 15, 21`
  - `h(12) = 0` → Bucket 0 → `[12]`
  - `h(15) = 0` → Bucket 0 → `[12, 15]`
  - `h(21) = 0` → Bucket 0 → `[12, 15, 21]`

---

### 4. **Closed Hashing (Open Addressing)**
In closed hashing, collisions are resolved by finding an **alternative location** for the record within the same hash table.

#### **Collision Resolution Techniques:**
1. **Linear Probing**:
   - Search for the next available slot in a sequential manner.
   - Example: If `Bucket 2` is full, try `Bucket 3`, then `Bucket 4`, and so on.
2. **Quadratic Probing**:
   - Search for the next available slot using a quadratic function, e.g., `i^2`.
   - Example: If `Bucket 2` is full, try `Bucket 3`, then `Bucket 6`, and so on.
3. **Double Hashing**:
   - Use a second hash function to determine the next slot.
   - Example: If `h1(Key)` fails, use `h2(Key)` to find the next slot.

#### **Advantages:**
- Avoids linked lists.
- Better utilization of storage.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- Clustering can occur (especially in linear probing).
- Limited number of records that can be stored.

#### **Example:**
- Hash Function: `h(Key) = Key % 5`
- Keys: `12, 22, 32`
  - `h(12) = 2` → Bucket 2
  - `h(22) = 2` → Collision → Try next bucket → Bucket 3
  - `h(32) = 2` → Collision → Try next bucket → Bucket 4

## **Advantages of Hashing Techniques**

1. **Fast Access**:
   - Hashing provides constant-time access for equality-based queries.
2. **Efficient for Large Datasets**:
   - Can handle large datasets with minimal performance degradation.
3. **Collision Handling**:
   - Techniques like chaining and probing effectively manage collisions.

## **Disadvantages of Hashing Techniques**

1. **Inefficient for Range Queries**:
   - Hashing is not suitable for range-based queries since data is not stored in sorted order.
2. **Space Overhead**:
   - Collision handling methods like chaining require additional storage.
3. **Hash Function Dependency**:
   - Poor hash function design can lead to clustering and uneven data distribution.

## **Real-World Applications of Hashing**

1. **Databases**:
   - Hashing is used in indexing and hash-based join algorithms.
2. **Caches**:
   - Hash tables are used in in-memory caching systems like Redis and Memcached.
3. **File Systems**:
   - Hashing helps locate files efficiently in distributed systems.
4. **Blockchain**:
   - Hashing ensures data integrity and quick lookup in distributed ledgers.

## **Example: E-Commerce System**

### **Scenario**:
An e-commerce system uses hashing to store customer records based on `CustomerID`.

### **Implementation**:
1. **Hash Function**: `h(CustomerID) = CustomerID % 10`
2. **Keys**: `101, 102, 203`
3. **Storage**:
   - `h(101) = 1` → Bucket 1 → `[101]`
   - `h(102) = 2` → Bucket 2 → `[102]`
   - `h(203) = 3` → Bucket 3 → `[203]`

If a collision occurs (e.g., `204` also maps to Bucket 3):
- Use chaining to store `[203, 204]`.
