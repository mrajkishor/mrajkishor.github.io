# üß© Built-in Middleware in Express.js: Simplifying Common Tasks

Middleware is the backbone of Express.js ‚Äî every request in an Express app flows through a chain of middleware functions before reaching the response. Among these, **built-in middleware** functions provided by Express make handling common tasks like serving static files or parsing JSON bodies straightforward and efficient.

---

## üß† What is Middleware in Express?

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the `req`, `res`, and `next` objects. They can:

* Execute any code
* Modify the request or response objects
* End the request-response cycle
* Call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware

Express offers **built-in middleware** to handle the most common use cases, reducing the need for external dependencies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Built-in Middleware in Express

### 1. `express.static()`

**Purpose**: Serves static files such as images, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc.

**Example**:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.static('public'));
```

> Now any file inside the `public/` folder (e.g., `public/style.css`) can be accessed directly via `/style.css`.

---

### 2. `express.json()`

**Purpose**: Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and populates `req.body`.

**Example**:

```js
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // Parsed JSON object
  res.send('Received JSON data');
});
```

> Replaces body-parser's `json()` method in newer versions of Express (v4.16.0+).

---

### 3. `express.urlencoded()`

**Purpose**: Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (as sent by HTML forms).

**Example**:

```js
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post('/form', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // Parsed form data
  res.send('Form submitted');
});
```

> The `extended: true` option allows nested objects via the `qs` library.

## ‚ùå Deprecated Built-in Middleware (Now External)

In earlier versions, Express bundled some middleware that is now maintained as **separate npm modules**:

| Middleware     | Current Usage                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `bodyParser`   | Now use `express.json()` & `express.urlencoded()` |
| `cookieParser` | Use `cookie-parser` npm package                   |
| `session`      | Use `express-session` package                     |
| `logger`       | Use `morgan` or `winston`                         |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Order of Middleware Matters

Built-in middleware must be used **before** your routes if they are needed for request processing.

```js
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/submit', handler); // ‚úÖ Works

app.post('/submit', handler); 
app.use(express.json());      // ‚ùå Won‚Äôt parse req.body
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Middleware             | Use Case                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `express.static()`     | Serve static files          |
| `express.json()`       | Parse JSON request bodies   |
| `express.urlencoded()` | Parse URL-encoded form data |

## üß¨ Final Thoughts

Express's built-in middleware provides essential tools for handling everyday tasks like request parsing and serving files ‚Äî all without external libraries. By mastering these core components, you can streamline your development process and build cleaner, more efficient Express applications.
