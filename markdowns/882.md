### **Combinational Circuits – Overview**

A **combinational circuit** is a type of digital logic circuit in which the output depends solely on the current input values, not on previous inputs or outputs (i.e., no memory element is involved). These circuits are constructed using basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) and are used to perform various arithmetic and logical operations.

### **Key Characteristics**

* No feedback or memory: purely depends on current inputs.
* Output changes immediately when inputs change.
* Can have **n inputs** and **m outputs**.
* Examples include: Adders, Subtractors, Multiplexers, Demultiplexers, Encoders, Decoders.

### **1. Half Adder**

* **Purpose**: Adds two single-bit binary numbers.
* **Inputs**: A and B.
* **Outputs**:

  * **Sum (S)** = A ⊕ B
  * **Carry (C)** = A ⋅ B
* **Limitation**: Cannot handle carry from previous addition.

---

### **2. Full Adder**

* **Purpose**: Adds three bits – two inputs (A, B) and a carry-in (Cin).
* **Inputs**: A, B, Cin.
* **Outputs**:

  * **Sum** = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin
  * **Carry-out** = (A ⋅ B) + (B ⋅ Cin) + (A ⋅ Cin)
* **Used in**: Cascading full adders for multi-bit addition.

### **3. N-bit Parallel Adder**

* **Purpose**: Adds two n-bit binary numbers using multiple full adders.
* Each full adder handles one bit and carries to the next.
* Carries are propagated forward in a "ripple-carry" manner.

---

### **4. N-bit Parallel Subtractor**

* **Purpose**: Performs subtraction of two n-bit binary numbers using 2's complement method.
* **A - B = A + (2’s complement of B)**.
* Uses a parallel adder circuit with complemented B and a carry-in of 1.

### **5. Half Subtractor**

* **Purpose**: Subtracts two single-bit binary values.
* **Inputs**: A (minuend), B (subtrahend).
* **Outputs**:

  * **Difference** = A ⊕ B
  * **Borrow** = A̅ ⋅ B
* **Limitation**: Cannot process previous borrow.

---

### **6. Full Subtractor**

* **Purpose**: Subtracts three bits: A (minuend), B (subtrahend), and Bin (borrow-in).
* **Outputs**:

  * **Difference** = A ⊕ B ⊕ Bin
  * **Borrow-out** = A̅ ⋅ (B ⊕ Bin) + B ⋅ Bin

---

### **7. Multiplexer (MUX)**

* **Purpose**: Selects one of many data inputs and forwards it to a single output.
* **Inputs**: n data inputs, m select lines (where n = 2^m), 1 output.
* **Operation**: Based on the binary value of select lines, one input is routed to output.

---

### **8. Demultiplexer (DEMUX)**

* **Purpose**: Takes one input and routes it to one of several outputs based on select lines.
* **Inputs**: 1 data input, m select lines.
* **Outputs**: 2^m outputs.
* **Use case**: Routing data from a single source to multiple destinations.

### **Applications of Combinational Circuits**

* Digital calculators and arithmetic units.
* Data routing in communication systems.
* Binary code converters.
* Memory address decoding.
* Logic decision-making systems.
