## üñ•Ô∏è Computer Instructions

Computer instructions are **low-level commands** that a processor understands and executes directly. These are written in **machine language**, a binary format consisting of sequences of bits that control the processor's behavior.

### üî∏ **Instruction Fields**

Every computer instruction is divided into multiple **fields**, each serving a specific purpose:

* **Opcode (Operation Code)**:
  Indicates the **operation** to be performed (e.g., ADD, SUB, LOAD).

* **Address Field**:
  Specifies the **location** of the operand (either in memory or a register).

* **Mode Field**:
  Determines **how** to interpret the address (direct, indirect, immediate, etc.).

### üîπ **Types of Instructions in a Basic Computer**

A basic computer supports **three categories** of instruction formats:

#### 1. **Memory-Reference Instructions**

* Use **12-bit addresses** to access memory.
* The **‚ÄòI‚Äô bit** (bit 15) specifies the **addressing mode**:

  * `I = 0`: Direct Addressing
  * `I = 1`: Indirect Addressing
* Used to perform operations involving memory locations (e.g., `LDA`, `ADD`, `STA`, `BUN`).

#### 2. **Register-Reference Instructions**

* Identified when **Opcode = `111`** and the **15th bit = 0**
* Operate **directly on processor registers**, especially the **AC (Accumulator)**.
* Examples: `CLA` (Clear Accumulator), `CMA` (Complement Accumulator)

#### 3. **Input-Output Instructions**

* Also use **Opcode = `111`**, but **15th bit = 1**
* Do **not reference memory**; instead, they communicate with **I/O devices**.
* Final 12 bits of instruction define the **specific I/O operation**.
* Examples: `INP` (Input character), `OUT` (Output character)

### ‚úÖ **Instruction Set Completeness**

A computer is said to have a **complete instruction set** when it supports the following operations:

| **Category**                        | **Purpose**                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Arithmetic, Logical, Shift**   | For performing calculations and bitwise operations                        |
| 2. **Data Transfer Instructions**   | Move data between memory and CPU registers                                |
| 3. **Program Control Instructions** | Control execution flow, like jumps, branches, or conditional instructions |
| 4. **Input-Output Instructions**    | Communicate with external I/O devices                                     |

This ensures the system is **capable of performing any computation** or data manipulation the user needs.

### üí° **Why Instructions Are Structured This Way**

* Instructions must be **compact and efficient**, fitting within a fixed word size (e.g., 16-bit or 32-bit).
* Opcode and operand addresses must be **clearly separated** for decoding by control units.
* A processor must **interpret, fetch, and execute** instructions as quickly as possible, making structured formats critical for performance.

### üß† Summary Table

| **Instruction Type** | **Opcode** | **Bit 15 (MSB)** | **Uses Memory?** | **Target**                       |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Memory-Reference     | 000‚Äì110    | 0 or 1 (I bit)   | Yes              | Memory (with or w/o indirection) |
| Register-Reference   | 111        | 0                | No               | Accumulator / Flags              |
| Input-Output         | 111        | 1                | No               | I/O Devices                      |
