# Exploring Native Queries in JPA

While JPA and JPQL provide an abstraction over database interactions, there are scenarios where developers need to execute raw SQL queries directly for advanced functionality, custom optimizations, or specific database features. Native Queries in JPA allow you to use SQL directly while still leveraging JPA's powerful entity management.

In this blog, we will explore Native Queries in detail, including their setup, usage, and practical examples.

## What Are Native Queries?

Native Queries in JPA allow developers to execute raw SQL queries directly against the database. Unlike JPQL, which operates on entities and attributes, Native Queries work with tables and columns, providing greater flexibility and control.

### Key Features:
1. **Direct SQL Execution**: Use raw SQL for advanced database operations.
2. **Entity Integration**: Map query results to JPA entities.
3. **Custom Optimizations**: Leverage database-specific features and optimizations.
4. **Flexibility**: Execute complex queries or stored procedures not supported by JPQL.

## Defining and Using Native Queries

### 1. **Using `@Query` Annotation**

The `@Query` annotation allows developers to define and execute native SQL queries directly within repository interfaces.

#### Example:

```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import java.util.List;

public interface EmployeeRepository extends CrudRepository<Employee, Long> {

    @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = :department", nativeQuery = true)
    List<Employee> findByDepartment(String department);
}
```

### 2. **Using `@NamedNativeQuery`**

The `@NamedNativeQuery` annotation allows you to define reusable native queries in the entity class.

#### Example:

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@NamedNativeQuery(
    name = "Employee.findHighSalaryEmployees",
    query = "SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > :salary",
    resultClass = Employee.class
)
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String department;
    private double salary;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

#### Accessing Named Native Query:

```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import java.util.List;

public interface EmployeeRepository extends CrudRepository<Employee, Long> {

    @Query(nativeQuery = true, name = "Employee.findHighSalaryEmployees")
    List<Employee> findHighSalaryEmployees(double salary);
}
```

### 3. **Using EntityManager**

The `EntityManager` provides a programmatic way to execute native queries.

#### Example:

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;
import javax.persistence.Query;
import java.util.List;

@Repository
public class EmployeeCustomRepository {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    public List<Object[]> findDepartmentWiseAverageSalary() {
        String sql = "SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employee GROUP BY department";
        Query query = entityManager.createNativeQuery(sql);
        return query.getResultList();
    }
}
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Retrieve Employees by Department

#### Repository:

```java
@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = :department", nativeQuery = true)
List<Employee> findByDepartment(String department);
```

#### Usage:

```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

public void fetchByDepartment() {
    List<Employee> employees = employeeRepository.findByDepartment("IT");
    employees.forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

#### SQL Execution:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = 'IT';
```

### Example 2: Find High Salary Employees

#### Named Native Query:

```java
@NamedNativeQuery(
    name = "Employee.findHighSalaryEmployees",
    query = "SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > :salary",
    resultClass = Employee.class
)
```

#### Usage:

```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

public void fetchHighSalaryEmployees() {
    List<Employee> employees = employeeRepository.findHighSalaryEmployees(70000);
    employees.forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

#### SQL Execution:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 70000;
```

### Example 3: Department-Wise Average Salary

#### Custom Query Using EntityManager:

```java
public List<Object[]> findDepartmentWiseAverageSalary() {
    String sql = "SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employee GROUP BY department";
    Query query = entityManager.createNativeQuery(sql);
    return query.getResultList();
}
```

#### Usage:

```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeCustomRepository customRepository;

public void fetchAverageSalaries() {
    List<Object[]> results = customRepository.findDepartmentWiseAverageSalary();
    for (Object[] result : results) {
        System.out.println("Department: " + result[0] + ", Average Salary: " + result[1]);
    }
}
```

#### SQL Execution:
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employee GROUP BY department;
```

## Best Practices for Using Native Queries

1. **Avoid Overuse**:
   - Use Native Queries only when JPQL or Criteria API cannot achieve the desired result.

2. **Validate Queries**:
   - Ensure queries are optimized and tested for performance.

3. **Leverage Result Mapping**:
   - Use `@SqlResultSetMapping` for complex result mappings.

4. **Named Queries for Reusability**:
   - Define queries using `@NamedNativeQuery` to avoid inline SQL duplication.

5. **Parameter Binding**:
   - Always use parameterized queries (e.g., `:parameter`) to prevent SQL injection.

## Advantages of Native Queries

1. **Database-Specific Features**: Utilize database-specific functionality like window functions or custom operators.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune queries for better performance.
3. **Flexibility**: Execute complex queries or stored procedures.
4. **Direct SQL Interaction**: Useful for legacy systems where SQL queries are predefined.

---

## Limitations of Native Queries

1. **Database Dependence**: Queries are tied to a specific database, reducing portability.
2. **Reduced Abstraction**: Direct interaction with tables/columns bypasses JPA's ORM features.
3. **Complex Mapping**: Handling complex result mappings can be cumbersome.

## Conclusion

Native Queries in JPA provide a powerful mechanism for executing raw SQL when JPQL or the Criteria API are insufficient. They are ideal for leveraging database-specific features, optimizing performance, and handling advanced use cases. By combining Native Queries with JPA's entity management, developers can achieve a perfect balance between flexibility and maintainability. Experiment with Native Queries to handle complex database interactions effectively!
