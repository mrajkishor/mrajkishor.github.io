### üìå Examples of System Calls in Linux and Windows

While all modern operating systems provide system calls to perform essential tasks like reading files or creating processes, **Linux and Windows have different implementations and naming conventions** for system calls. But the **core idea** remains the same: to allow user programs to safely interact with the OS kernel.

## üêß Linux System Call Examples

Linux system calls are typically exposed through **standard C library functions** like `open()`, `read()`, `fork()`, etc. Internally, these functions invoke a **system call using a trap to kernel mode** (usually via software interrupt or `syscall` instruction).

### üß™ Common Linux System Calls (Used in GATE/Practice)

| **Function**       | **System Call Purpose**                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `fork()`           | Create a new child process (duplicate of parent) |
| `execve()`         | Replace current process image with a new program |
| `wait()`           | Wait for a child process to terminate            |
| `exit()`           | Terminate the process                            |
| `getpid()`         | Get process ID                                   |
| `open()`           | Open a file                                      |
| `read()`           | Read from a file or device                       |
| `write()`          | Write to a file or device                        |
| `close()`          | Close a file descriptor                          |
| `kill()`           | Send a signal to a process                       |
| `pipe()`           | Create a unidirectional data channel             |
| `mmap()`           | Map files or devices into memory                 |
| `brk()` / `sbrk()` | Control heap memory for dynamic allocation       |

üîß **Low-Level Syscall Interface**:

* Linux also has a syscall interface via the `syscall()` function and **syscall numbers** (defined in `<unistd.h>`).
* Example: `__NR_read`, `__NR_write` are syscall numbers used in assembly/syscall tables.

üìå **Linux uses unified file descriptors** ‚Äî even devices and sockets are treated like files (`read()`, `write()` work on them too).

## ü™ü Windows System Call Examples

Windows is more complex and **abstracted**. Developers rarely use system calls directly ‚Äî instead, they call functions from the **Windows API**, which internally may invoke **native system calls** to the NT kernel.

### üß™ Common Windows API Functions (User-level APIs)

| **Function**            | **Purpose**                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `CreateProcess()`       | Create a new process               |
| `ExitProcess()`         | Terminate a process                |
| `WaitForSingleObject()` | Wait for a process or thread       |
| `CreateFile()`          | Open or create a file/device       |
| `ReadFile()`            | Read from a file/device            |
| `WriteFile()`           | Write to a file/device             |
| `CloseHandle()`         | Close a file/process/thread handle |
| `GetCurrentProcessId()` | Get process ID                     |
| `Sleep()`               | Pause execution for a period       |

üîç **Under the Hood**:

* These functions interact with **NTDLL.DLL**, which invokes **Nt/Zw-prefixed system calls** like `NtCreateFile`, `NtReadFile`, etc.
* These are true system calls that interact with the **Windows NT kernel**.

üîê Windows uses **handles** instead of file descriptors. A handle is a reference to an OS-managed resource (file, thread, etc.).

## üîÑ Comparison: Linux vs Windows

| Feature              | **Linux**                      | **Windows**                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| System Call Exposure | Direct via C library (`glibc`) | Indirect via WinAPI ‚Üí NTDLL ‚Üí Kernel        |
| Process Creation     | `fork()`, `exec()`             | `CreateProcess()`                           |
| File I/O             | `open()`, `read()`, `write()`  | `CreateFile()`, `ReadFile()`, `WriteFile()` |
| Identifiers          | File Descriptors (integers)    | Handles (opaque references)                 |
| API Style            | POSIX standard                 | Windows-specific WinAPI                     |

## üß† GATE Insight

* GATE mostly focuses on **Linux-style** system calls since Linux is **open-source, POSIX-compliant**, and easier to test conceptually.
* You may get MCQs where you have to **trace `fork()` trees**, **count processes**, or **match file I/O operations**.

---

## üìù Summary

* Linux exposes system calls transparently; Windows hides them behind APIs.
* Despite platform differences, both OSes perform the same set of core tasks.
* Understanding both is useful for OS design, debugging, and system-level programming.
