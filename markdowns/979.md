## 🧠 What Is a Machine Coding Round?

In Enterprise and top product companies, a **machine coding round** is a 90–120 min take-home or live coding session where you're asked to **design and build a full UI module** from scratch — not just solve an algorithm.

> 📌 It's not about getting it “done” — it’s about **how you structure** it: modularity, reusability, testability, and maintainability.

# ✅ React Machine Coding Problems

---

### 1. 📊 **Sortable & Filterable Table**

**Prompt:**
Build a table UI with the following features:

* Sort by column (ascending/descending)
* Filter by search input (debounced)
* Pagination (client-side)
* Reusable `Table`, `TableRow`, and `TableHeader` components

**Bonus:**

* Column visibility toggle
* Server-side data fetch with loading spinner

🧠 *Assesses:* State lifting, controlled components, composition, debounce, data flow.

---

### 2. 🧾 **Todo App with Tag Filtering and Persistence**

**Prompt:**
Create a Todo App with:

* Add/delete/edit tasks
* Assign tags to tasks (e.g., `["work", "urgent"]`)
* Filter tasks by tag
* Persist state using `localStorage`

**Bonus:**

* Use `React.Context` for global state
* Write using TypeScript

🧠 *Assesses:* Form handling, persistence, filtering, component design, global vs local state.

---

### 3. ⌛ **Debounced Auto-Suggest Search**

**Prompt:**
Build a search bar that:

* Shows suggestions fetched from an API (use mock JSON)
* Highlights matching characters
* Supports keyboard navigation (↑ ↓ ↵)
* Debounced input (500ms)

🧠 *Assesses:* `useEffect`, debounce, cleanup, accessibility, performance.

---

### 4. 📆 **Custom Date Picker Component**

**Prompt:**
Create a reusable `DatePicker`:

* Click to open calendar dropdown
* Navigate months
* Select date and return it to parent

**Bonus:**

* Disable past/future dates
* Range selection mode

🧠 *Assesses:* Controlled components, event handling, refs, reusability, keyboard support.

---

### 5. 📂 **Folder-Tree File Explorer (like VS Code sidebar)**

**Prompt:**
Render a collapsible folder/file tree:

* Nested JSON structure
* Expand/collapse on click
* Highlight selected file

**Bonus:**

* Right-click to rename/delete
* Drag-and-drop reordering

🧠 *Assesses:* Recursion, state trees, component communication, dynamic rendering.

---

### 6. 🧮 **Calculator with History**

**Prompt:**
Implement a calculator that:

* Supports +, -, ×, ÷, C, =, CE
* Shows past 5 calculations in a scrollable history

🧠 *Assesses:* Event flow, UI rendering, keyboard bindings, edge case handling.

---

### 7. 🎫 **Ticket Booking Grid (Seat Selection)**

**Prompt:**
Build a seat selection UI:

* Render grid of seats (A1–F10)
* Click to select/deselect
* Show summary of selected seats and total price

**Bonus:**

* Use Context or Redux for seat state
* Disable booked seats from a `bookedSeats[]` prop

🧠 *Assesses:* Grid rendering, dynamic styling, state sharing, accessibility.

---

### 8. 📈 **Live Search with API Integration (React + Fetch)**

**Prompt:**

* Use the GitHub Users API to search for usernames
* Show avatars, name, bio
* Debounce API requests
* Show loading/error states

🧠 *Assesses:* Async data fetching, hooks, error handling, UI state management.

---

### 9. 🧩 **Kanban Board (Trello Clone)**

**Prompt:**

* Multiple columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
* Add/edit tasks
* Drag tasks between columns
* Persist state in `localStorage`

🧠 *Assesses:* Drag-and-drop (`react-beautiful-dnd`), state lifting, modular architecture, UX focus.

---

### 10. 🧰 **Component Library: Build `Modal` and `Tooltip`**

**Prompt:**

* Create reusable `<Modal>` and `<Tooltip>` components
* Accept `children`, `onClose`, `position` props
* Use `React.Portal` for rendering
* Escape key closes modal

🧠 *Assesses:* Portals, accessibility, component API design, reusability.

## 🧪 Bonus: Architecture Focus

In these rounds, interviewers also look for:

| Area                   | Expectation                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Folder Structure       | Organized: `components/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`   |
| Component Splitting    | Reusable, DRY, meaningful names                |
| State Management       | Local, Context, or Redux when needed           |
| TypeScript (if used)   | Strict typing, props/interfaces                |
| Performance            | Debouncing, memoization, clean re-renders      |
| Clean Code             | Proper naming, readability, no `any`, comments |
| Testability (optional) | Bonus if component is testable with `Jest`/RTL |
