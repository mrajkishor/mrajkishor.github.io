# üß† Understanding 1D vs Multi-dimensional Dynamic Programming (DP)

**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a technique to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem once, and storing the result to avoid redundant work. DP is commonly applied to optimization problems, where you want to **maximize** or **minimize** a value.

In this blog, we‚Äôll explore:

- What is 1D DP?
- What is Multi-dimensional DP?
- When to use which?
- Code examples to clarify each.
- Comparison and tips.

## üìå 1D Dynamic Programming

### ‚úÖ What is 1D DP?

**1D DP** means using a one-dimensional array (or list) to store intermediate results.

This is applicable when:
- Each subproblem depends only on one variable.
- You can optimize space by reducing a 2D DP to 1D.

### üßæ Example 1: Fibonacci Numbers

#### Problem:
Find the `n`-th Fibonacci number, where:
```
Fib(0) = 0
Fib(1) = 1
Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
```

#### üîç DP Idea:
We only need the last two values, so a 1D array (or even two variables) is sufficient.

```java
public int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n+1];
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    return dp[n];
}
```

üëâ **Space Optimized**:
```java
int a = 0, b = 1;
for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int temp = a + b;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
return b;
```

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)` or `O(n)` if array is used

## üìå Multi-dimensional DP

### ‚úÖ What is Multi-dimensional DP?

When a problem depends on **more than one changing variable**, you often need **2D** or even **3D** DP arrays.

Use it when:
- The subproblem's state is defined by 2 or more parameters.
- You‚Äôre solving grid-based, knapsack, or substring problems.

### üßæ Example 2: 0/1 Knapsack Problem

#### Problem:
Given `n` items with weights and values, and a maximum capacity `W`, find the max value that can be carried.

#### üîç DP State:
Let `dp[i][w]` be the maximum value for the first `i` items and capacity `w`.

```java
int n = weights.length;
int[][] dp = new int[n+1][W+1];

for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
        if (weights[i-1] <= w)
            dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i-1][w], values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]]);
        else
            dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity**: `O(n * W)`  
**Space Complexity**: `O(n * W)`

üëâ Can be optimized to 1D if you reverse the inner loop:
```java
int[] dp = new int[W+1];
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int w = W; w >= weights[i]; w--) {
        dp[w] = Math.max(dp[w], values[i] + dp[w - weights[i]]);
    }
}
```

### üßæ Example 3: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence.

Let `dp[i][j]` = LCS of first `i` chars of `s1` and first `j` chars of `s2`.

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        if (s1.charAt(i-1) == s2.charAt(j-1))
            dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1];
        else
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
    }
}
```

**Time**: `O(m * n)`  
**Space**: `O(m * n)`, can be optimized to `O(min(m, n))`

| Feature                  | 1D DP                            | Multi-dimensional DP                     |

| Common examples         | Fibonacci, Climbing stairs       | Knapsack, LCS, Matrix DP problems        |
| Space optimization      | Often possible                   | Possible in some cases (reverse loops)   |

## üí° When to Use Which?

- ‚úÖ Use **1D DP** if:
  - The current state only depends on the previous few states.
  - You can iterate in a way to re-use values (e.g. from back to front).

- ‚úÖ Use **Multi-dimensional DP** if:
  - Multiple parameters are changing.
  - You can‚Äôt express all state changes in a linear fashion.

---

## üîö Conclusion

- Start with identifying the **state variables**: How many variables determine the subproblem?
- Then choose between **1D** and **multi-D DP** accordingly.
- Always look out for **space optimization** opportunities.

Understanding the type of DP required is key to writing optimal and scalable solutions. Mastering both styles opens the door to solving a huge range of interview and competitive programming problems.
