### ◄ Bit Manipulation

#### ❓ **Set-based subsets or XOR logic?**

→ **Use Bit Masks or XOR**

---

### 📌 **When to Use:**

* You need to **generate all subsets** of a set.
* You want to **check/set/unset specific bits**.
* You’re solving **XOR-based problems** (e.g., single number, missing number).
* You want **space-efficient representation** of combinations.

### 🔢 **Bit Masking for Subsets**


#### 🔍 **Concept**

Each subset of a set can be represented using a **binary number (bitmask)** — where each bit represents whether an element is **included (1)** or **excluded (0)**.

---

### 🧠 **Why It Works**

For a set of size `n`, there are `2ⁿ` possible subsets.
If `nums = [a, b, c]`, then:

| Binary (Bitmask) | Subset     |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| 000              | \[]        |
| 001              | \[c]       |
| 010              | \[b]       |
| 011              | \[b, c]    |
| 100              | \[a]       |
| 101              | \[a, c]    |
| 110              | \[a, b]    |
| 111              | \[a, b, c] |

---

### ✅ **Java Code**

```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
int n = nums.length;

for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
    List<Integer> subset = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
            subset.add(nums[i]); // include nums[i]
        }
    }
    System.out.println(subset);
}
```

---

### 📈 **Complexity**

* **Time:** O(n × 2ⁿ)
* **Space:** O(n) per subset (plus output list)

---

### 💡 **Use When**

* You need to generate all subsets (power set)
* You want a fast, loop-based alternative to backtracking
* You want to represent inclusion/exclusion in a compact form

---

> 🧩 **Bitmasking** gives a binary view of all combinations — powerful, efficient, and elegant for subset generation problems.

### ✅ **Explanation of Code — Subset Generation using Bit Masking**

```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
int n = nums.length;
```

* `nums` is the input array.
* `n = 3`, so the total number of subsets = `2^3 = 8`.

---

```java
for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
```

* `1 << n` is `2^n`, i.e., `1 shifted left n times`.
* `mask` runs from `0` to `7` (`000` to `111` in binary).
* Each `mask` represents a unique subset.

---

```java
List<Integer> subset = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
        subset.add(nums[i]); // include nums[i]
    }
}
```

* This loop checks **each bit of the mask**:

  * If the **i-th bit** is `1`, include `nums[i]` in the subset.
  * `(1 << i)` creates a bitmask like `001`, `010`, `100`, etc.
  * `mask & (1 << i)` checks if that bit is set.

---

```java
System.out.println(subset);
```

* Prints the generated subset for that mask.

---

### 🧠 **What It Prints (for nums = \[1, 2, 3]):**

```
[]
[1]
[2]
[1, 2]
[3]
[1, 3]
[2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
```

---

### 📘 **Prerequisites to Understand This Code:**

1. ✅ **Binary Representation**
   Understand how numbers like `0 to 7` map to binary (`000` to `111`).

2. ✅ **Bitwise AND (`&`)**
   Know that `a & b` returns `1` only if both bits are `1`.

3. ✅ **Bit Shift (`<<`)**
   `1 << i` means shifting `1` to the left by `i` bits (i.e., `2^i`).

4. ✅ **Subset Concept (Power Set)**
   Total subsets of a set with `n` elements = `2^n`.

---

### 🔥 Summary:

This code uses **bitmasking** to generate **all possible subsets** of an array efficiently, without recursion. Each bit in the `mask` determines whether to include the corresponding element.

### ◄ Bit Shift Operators in Java

Bit shift operators are used to shift bits left or right, often for fast multiplication, division, or bitmask operations.

---

### 🔁 **Types of Bit Shifts**

#### 1️⃣ `<<` — **Left Shift**

* Shifts bits to the **left**, filling with `0` on the right.
* Equivalent to multiplying by `2^n`.

```java
int x = 3;        // binary: 00000011
int y = x << 2;   // result: 00001100 = 12
```

> 💡 `x << n` = `x × 2ⁿ`

---

#### 2️⃣ `>>` — **Signed Right Shift**

* Shifts bits to the **right**, preserving the sign (MSB stays).
* Equivalent to dividing by `2^n`.

```java
int x = -8;       // binary: 11111000
int y = x >> 2;   // result: 11111110 = -2
```

> 💡 `x >> n` = `x / 2ⁿ` (rounded down)

---

#### 3️⃣ `>>>` — **Unsigned Right Shift**

* Shifts bits to the **right**, filling with `0` from the left (no sign preservation).

```java
int x = -8;         // binary: 11111111_11111111_11111111_11111000
int y = x >>> 2;    // result: 00111111_11111111_11111111_11111110
```

> 💡 Use when working with binary data (e.g., hashing, compression)

---

### 📦 **Common Use Cases**

* Efficient multiplication/division by powers of 2
* Bitmask generation: `1 << i` sets only the `i-th` bit
* Checking or toggling bits
* Generating subsets via bitmasking

### 🧠 Summary Table

| Operator | Name                   | Behavior                        | Equivalent |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `<<`     | Left Shift             | Shifts bits left, fills with 0s | `× 2ⁿ`     |
| `>>`     | Right Shift (signed)   | Shifts right, keeps sign        | `/ 2ⁿ`     |
| `>>>`    | Right Shift (unsigned) | Shifts right, fills with 0s     | binary op  |

---

> 🧠 Bit shifting is a powerful low-level tool for fast computation, especially in **DSA**, **compression**, **encryption**, and **graphics**.




---

### ⚡ **XOR Logic**

* `a ^ a = 0`
* `a ^ 0 = a`
* XOR is **commutative** and **associative**

**Use case:** Find the single non-duplicate number:

```java
int xor = 0;
for (int num : nums) {
    xor ^= num;
}
return xor; // returns the unique number
```


In the standard **XOR-based single number problem**:

### ✅ Rule:

> **Every number appears exactly twice** except **one number that appears once**.



---

### ⚠️ So:

* If a number appears **only once**, it **won’t cancel out** and will be returned.
* If numbers appear **more than twice (like 3 or 4 times)**, XOR **won’t work** correctly.

---

### ✅ Valid Input Example:

```java
int[] nums = {2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 5, 9}; // Output: 9
```

### ❌ Invalid Input Example:

```java
int[] nums = {2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4}; // Not valid for XOR trick — need a different method
```

---

> 🔄 For variations like "every number appears **3 times** except one", you need **bit counting** or a special mask approach.




---

### 🧠 **Why It's Powerful:**

* **No extra space** required for sets/maps in many cases.
* Ideal for problems involving **states, toggles, or unique detection**.
* Bitwise operations are **extremely fast**.

---

### 💡 Practice Problems:

* Subsets (Leetcode 78)
* Single Number (Leetcode 136)
* Counting Bits (Leetcode 338)
* Maximum XOR of Two Numbers (Leetcode 421)
* Bitwise AND of Numbers Range (Leetcode 201)
