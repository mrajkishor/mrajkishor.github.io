# ▶️ Running the Next.js Application – Development to Production



## 🧭 Introduction

Once you've created your **Next.js project**, the next step is to **run and manage your application** across different environments—**development**, **build**, and **production**.

This guide explains how to **run your Next.js app**, what happens behind the scenes, and how to deploy it for production.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Development Mode

This is where you'll spend most of your time writing and testing code.

### ✅ Command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### 📍 What it does:
- Starts the **development server** on `http://localhost:3000`
- Enables **Fast Refresh** for hot reloading components instantly
- Displays helpful **error messages** and stack traces
- Loads both **App Router** (`/app`) and **Pages Router** (`/pages`) if both exist

---

## 💡 Customizing the Port

You can run the server on a different port:

```bash
PORT=4000 npm run dev
```

---

## 🧱 2. Building for Production

To optimize your app for deployment, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 🔨 What this does:
- Compiles your project
- Runs **TypeScript** checks (if enabled)
- Optimizes JavaScript and CSS
- Pre-renders pages using **SSG** and **SSR**
- Generates a `.next` directory with compiled files

Build output will show:
- Total pages built
- Pages using SSR or SSG
- Any errors or warnings

---

## 🚀 3. Running Production Server

After building, use:

```bash
npm run start
```

### 🏁 This:
- Runs the optimized app from `.next/`
- Is useful for **testing in a production-like environment**
- Should only be used **after `npm run build`**

## 🧪 Useful Scripts Overview

| Script            | Purpose                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`     | Run development server with hot reload |
| `npm run build`   | Build the app for production           |
| `npm run start`   | Start production server                |
| `npm run lint`    | Run ESLint checks                      |
| `npm run test`    | (Optional) Run test suites             |

---

## 🌍 4. Deployment Options

After testing your build, you can deploy it.

### ✅ Option 1: Deploy to **Vercel** (Recommended)
```bash
npx vercel
```
- 1-click GitHub integration
- Auto-builds on commit
- Supports edge functions and ISR

### ✅ Option 2: Deploy on your server
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Host using **Node**, **Docker**, or **PM2**.

---

## 🧪 Testing Production Locally

Use this to simulate a real environment before deploying:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Visit:  
```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🧩 Advanced: Running with Custom Servers

If you need a custom backend (e.g., Express, Fastify), you can set it up like:

```js
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const next = require('next');

const app = next({ dev: false });
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

app.prepare().then(() => {
  const server = express();

  server.all('*', (req, res) => {
    return handle(req, res);
  });

  server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Ready on http://localhost:3000');
  });
});
```

Then run with:

```bash
node server.js
```

## 📚 Summary

| Mode            | Command         | Purpose                                  |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Development      | `npm run dev`     | Hot reload, testing, debugging            |
| Build            | `npm run build`   | Compile and optimize                     |
| Production       | `npm run start`   | Serve final optimized app                |
| Deployment       | `npx vercel`      | Deploy to Vercel or another host         |

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Running a Next.js app is straightforward, yet powerful. With just three core commands—**dev**, **build**, and **start**—you get a complete development-to-deployment pipeline.

> Whether you're testing locally or scaling globally, Next.js makes it seamless to go from code to production.
