# Exploring Joins and Aggregations in JPA Criteria API

The JPA Criteria API provides a powerful and type-safe way to construct dynamic queries, and two of its most essential features are **Joins** and **Aggregations**. These features enable developers to query related entities and perform complex calculations, making the Criteria API an indispensable tool for data manipulation and analysis.

In this blog, we will delve into **Joins** and **Aggregations**, their features, and practical examples to demonstrate their usage in real-world scenarios.

## Joins in JPA Criteria API

Joins allow you to query multiple entities with relationships, such as `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, or `@ManyToMany`. In the Criteria API, you can use joins to retrieve data from related entities efficiently.

### Types of Joins:
1. **Inner Join**: Retrieves only matching records from both entities.
2. **Left Join**: Retrieves all records from the left entity and matching records from the right entity.
3. **Fetch Join**: Retrieves associated entities in a single query (useful for eager loading).

### Example Entities: `Employee` and `Department`

```java
import javax.persistence.*;
import java.util.List;

@Entity
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private double salary;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    private Department department;

    // Getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class Department {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
    private List<Employee> employees;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

### Inner Join Example
Retrieve all employees along with their department names.

#### Code:
```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Object[]> cq = cb.createQuery(Object[].class);
Root<Employee> employeeRoot = cq.from(Employee.class);
Join<Employee, Department> departmentJoin = employeeRoot.join("department");

cq.multiselect(employeeRoot.get("name"), departmentJoin.get("name"));

List<Object[]> results = entityManager.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
for (Object[] result : results) {
    System.out.println("Employee: " + result[0] + ", Department: " + result[1]);
}
```

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### Left Join Example
Retrieve all departments and their employees, including departments with no employees.

#### Code:
```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Object[]> cq = cb.createQuery(Object[].class);
Root<Department> departmentRoot = cq.from(Department.class);
Join<Department, Employee> employeeJoin = departmentRoot.join("employees", JoinType.LEFT);

cq.multiselect(departmentRoot.get("name"), employeeJoin.get("name"));

List<Object[]> results = entityManager.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
for (Object[] result : results) {
    System.out.println("Department: " + result[0] + ", Employee: " + result[1]);
}
```

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT d.name, e.name
FROM department d
LEFT JOIN employee e ON d.id = e.department_id;
```

## Aggregations in JPA Criteria API

Aggregations allow you to perform calculations on data, such as sums, averages, counts, maximums, and minimums. These are particularly useful for generating reports or analyzing data.

### Common Aggregate Functions:
1. **`count`**: Counts the number of records.
2. **`avg`**: Calculates the average of a numeric column.
3. **`sum`**: Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
4. **`max` / `min`**: Finds the maximum or minimum value in a column.

---

### Example: Count Employees in Each Department
Retrieve the number of employees in each department.

#### Code:
```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Object[]> cq = cb.createQuery(Object[].class);
Root<Employee> employeeRoot = cq.from(Employee.class);

cq.multiselect(employeeRoot.get("department").get("name"), cb.count(employeeRoot))
  .groupBy(employeeRoot.get("department"));

List<Object[]> results = entityManager.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
for (Object[] result : results) {
    System.out.println("Department: " + result[0] + ", Count: " + result[1]);
}
```

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT d.name, COUNT(e.id)
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d ON e.department_id = d.id
GROUP BY d.name;
```

### Example: Calculate Average Salary per Department
Retrieve the average salary of employees in each department.

#### Code:
```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Object[]> cq = cb.createQuery(Object[].class);
Root<Employee> employeeRoot = cq.from(Employee.class);

cq.multiselect(employeeRoot.get("department").get("name"), cb.avg(employeeRoot.get("salary")))
  .groupBy(employeeRoot.get("department"));

List<Object[]> results = entityManager.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
for (Object[] result : results) {
    System.out.println("Department: " + result[0] + ", Average Salary: " + result[1]);
}
```

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT d.name, AVG(e.salary)
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d ON e.department_id = d.id
GROUP BY d.name;
```

## Combining Joins and Aggregations

### Example: Total Salary per Department with Employee Count
Retrieve the total salary and number of employees in each department.

#### Code:
```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Object[]> cq = cb.createQuery(Object[].class);
Root<Employee> employeeRoot = cq.from(Employee.class);

cq.multiselect(
    employeeRoot.get("department").get("name"),
    cb.sum(employeeRoot.get("salary")),
    cb.count(employeeRoot)
).groupBy(employeeRoot.get("department"));

List<Object[]> results = entityManager.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
for (Object[] result : results) {
    System.out.println("Department: " + result[0] + ", Total Salary: " + result[1] + ", Count: " + result[2]);
}
```

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT d.name, SUM(e.salary), COUNT(e.id)
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d ON e.department_id = d.id
GROUP BY d.name;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Joins Judiciously**:
   - Avoid unnecessary joins that may degrade performance.

2. **Optimize Aggregations**:
   - Index frequently queried columns to improve aggregation performance.

3. **Combine Joins and Aggregations Effectively**:
   - Use groupings wisely to avoid redundant computations.

4. **Test Queries**:
   - Verify the correctness and performance of generated SQL queries.
