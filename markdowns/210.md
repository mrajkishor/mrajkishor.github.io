# Exploring Derived Queries in Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA revolutionizes data access in Java applications by reducing boilerplate code. One of its standout features is **Derived Queries**, which allow developers to generate database queries automatically based on method names. This eliminates the need for writing complex SQL or JPQL queries manually for common operations.

In this blog, we will explore Derived Queries in detail, along with practical examples to demonstrate their power and flexibility. Additionally, we will delve into how Derived Queries can be used for update and delete operations, expanding their functionality beyond data retrieval.

## What Are Derived Queries?

Derived Queries are query methods in Spring Data JPA where the method name itself defines the query logic. Spring Data JPA parses these method names and generates the corresponding query automatically at runtime.

### Key Features:
1. **Declarative Querying**: Define queries directly in the method names.
2. **Simplicity**: Avoid manual SQL or JPQL for standard queries.
3. **Flexibility**: Support for multiple keywords, conditions, and logical operators.
4. **Versatility**: Can be used for data fetching, updating, and deleting.

## Setting Up Derived Queries

### Prerequisites
Ensure your project includes the necessary dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Example Entity: `Employee`

```java
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String department;
    private double salary;

    // Getters and setters

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getDepartment() {
        return department;
    }

    public void setDepartment(String department) {
        this.department = department;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
```

### Repository Interface

Extend `JpaRepository` to define query methods:

```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Modifying;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;
import java.util.List;

public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {

    // Derived query methods for fetching data
    List<Employee> findByDepartment(String department);

    List<Employee> findBySalaryGreaterThan(double salary);

    List<Employee> findByDepartmentAndSalaryGreaterThan(String department, double salary);

    List<Employee> findByNameContaining(String keyword);

    List<Employee> findByDepartmentOrderBySalaryDesc(String department);

    // Derived query methods for updating data
    @Modifying
    @Transactional
    @Query("UPDATE Employee e SET e.salary = :salary WHERE e.department = :department")
    int updateSalaryByDepartment(double salary, String department);

    // Derived query methods for deleting data
    @Modifying
    @Transactional
    @Query("DELETE FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :department")
    void deleteByDepartment(String department);
}
```

## How Derived Queries Work

Spring Data JPA parses the method names and translates them into SQL or JPQL queries. The method name must follow a specific convention:

### Syntax:
```
findBy<Property>[Condition][OrderBy<Property>]
```

### Keywords:
- **Logical Operators**: `And`, `Or`
- **Comparison**: `Is`, `Equals`, `GreaterThan`, `LessThan`, `Like`, `Containing`
- **Sorting**: `OrderBy`

### Example Translation:
- **Method**: `findByDepartmentAndSalaryGreaterThan(String department, double salary)`
- **Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = ? AND salary > ?;
  ```

---

## Practical Examples for Fetching Data

### 1. Find Employees by Department
```java
List<Employee> itEmployees = employeeRepository.findByDepartment("IT");
itEmployees.forEach(System.out::println);
```
**Generated Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = 'IT';
```

### 2. Find Employees with Salary Greater Than
```java
List<Employee> highEarners = employeeRepository.findBySalaryGreaterThan(50000);
highEarners.forEach(System.out::println);
```
**Generated Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 50000;
```

### 3. Find Employees by Department and Minimum Salary
```java
List<Employee> itHighEarners = employeeRepository.findByDepartmentAndSalaryGreaterThan("IT", 60000);
itHighEarners.forEach(System.out::println);
```
**Generated Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 60000;
```

### 4. Find Employees by Name Containing Keyword
```java
List<Employee> employeesWithNameKeyword = employeeRepository.findByNameContaining("John");
employeesWithNameKeyword.forEach(System.out::println);
```
**Generated Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE name LIKE '%John%';
```

### 5. Find Employees in Department Sorted by Salary (Descending)
```java
List<Employee> sortedEmployees = employeeRepository.findByDepartmentOrderBySalaryDesc("IT");
sortedEmployees.forEach(System.out::println);
```
**Generated Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = 'IT' ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

---

## Practical Examples for Updating and Deleting Data

### Update Employees' Salaries by Department
```java
int rowsUpdated = employeeRepository.updateSalaryByDepartment(70000, "IT");
System.out.println("Rows updated: " + rowsUpdated);
```
**Generated Query:**
```sql
UPDATE employee SET salary = 70000 WHERE department = 'IT';
```

### Delete Employees by Department
```java
employeeRepository.deleteByDepartment("HR");
System.out.println("Employees from HR department deleted.");
```
**Generated Query:**
```sql
DELETE FROM employee WHERE department = 'HR';
```

---

## Practical Example: REST Controller

### Controller:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/employees")
public class EmployeeController {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @GetMapping("/by-department")
    public List<Employee> getByDepartment(@RequestParam String department) {
        return employeeRepository.findByDepartment(department);
    }

    @GetMapping("/high-salary")
    public List<Employee> getHighEarners(@RequestParam double salary) {
        return employeeRepository.findBySalaryGreaterThan(salary);
    }

    @GetMapping("/filter")
    public List<Employee> getFilteredEmployees(@RequestParam String department, @RequestParam double salary) {
        return employeeRepository.findByDepartmentAndSalaryGreaterThan(department, salary);
    }

    @PutMapping("/update-salary")
    public int updateSalaries(@RequestParam double salary, @RequestParam String department) {
        return employeeRepository.updateSalaryByDepartment(salary, department);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/delete-by-department")
    public void deleteByDepartment(@RequestParam String department) {
        employeeRepository.deleteByDepartment(department);
    }
}
```

## Testing Derived Queries

### Using Postman or Curl
1. **Find by Department**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/employees/by-department?department=IT'
   ```

2. **Find High Earners**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/employees/high-salary?salary=50000'
   ```

3. **Filter by Department and Salary**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/employees/filter?department=IT&salary=60000'
   ```

4. **Update Salaries**:
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:8080/employees/update-salary?department=IT&salary=70000'
   ```

5. **Delete by Department**:
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/employees/delete-by-department?department=HR'
   ```

## Advantages of Derived Queries

1. **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: No need to manually write SQL or JPQL for common queries.
2. **Ease of Use**: Simple and declarative method naming.
3. **Readability**: Method names clearly indicate query intent.
4. **Flexibility**: Support for multiple conditions, logical operators, and sorting.
5. **Versatility**: Can be used for data fetching, updating, and deleting.
