---

### üîπ What is Indexing?

**Indexing** is a technique used in databases to **speed up the retrieval of rows** based on certain columns (usually search keys), similar to how an index in a book helps locate content quickly.

Instead of scanning the entire table, the database engine uses the index to **jump directly** to relevant rows.

---

### üîπ Why Index?

* To **optimize query performance**
* To improve **JOIN**, **WHERE**, **ORDER BY**, and **GROUP BY** operations
* To avoid **full table scans**

---

## üî∑ Types of Indexes in Relational Databases

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Primary Index**

* Built automatically on the **primary key**
* Index entries are **sorted**, and each entry points to the data record

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only **one primary index** per table

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Secondary Index (Non-clustered)**

* Created on **non-primary key** attributes
* Allows **faster access** on those fields
* Can be multiple secondary indexes per table

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON Employee(Email);
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Clustering Index**

* Data records are **physically sorted** based on this key
* Used when **records are grouped** by a non-primary key

> ‚úÖ Good for range queries and batch reads

### ‚úÖ 4. **Dense vs Sparse Index**

| Type             | Description                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dense Index**  | Index has **one entry for every record**                            |
| **Sparse Index** | Index has **entries for only some records** (usually one per block) |

> Dense = Faster lookups, more space
> Sparse = Less space, may require extra I/O

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Single-level vs Multi-level Index**

* **Single-Level**: One index pointing directly to data
* **Multi-Level**: Index over the index itself (like a B-tree)

  * Reduces disk reads
  * Index becomes scalable for large datasets

---

## üî∑ Tree-Based Indexing Structures

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **B+ Tree Indexing**

* Balanced tree with all values in the **leaf nodes**
* Internal nodes only store **keys**
* Leaves are **linked**, supporting **range queries**

> üåü **Standard choice** in most databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

#### ‚úÖ Operations:

* Search: Logarithmic time
* Insertion/Deletion: Efficient re-balancing

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Hash Indexing**

* Uses a **hash function** to map key values to bucket addresses
* **Fastest for equality** (`=`) searches

> ‚ùå **Not suitable** for range queries or sorted outputs

## üß† When to Use Which Index?

| Requirement                         | Use Index Type              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Exact lookup (`=`)                  | Hash index                  |
| Range queries (`<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`) | B+ Tree index               |
| JOINs on foreign key                | Secondary index             |
| Sorting/grouping                    | Clustered index             |
| High read/write ratio               | Sparse or multi-level index |

---

## üìã Example

Assume a `Student` table with 1 million rows.
You frequently query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE RollNo = 2021234;
```

‚úÖ **Best Index**: Primary + B+ Tree ‚Üí Fast retrieval in O(log n)

## üßæ Summary Recap Table

| Index Type      | Best For             | Supports Ranges | Notes                        |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Primary Index   | Primary key lookup   | ‚úÖ Yes           | One per table                |
| Secondary Index | Non-PK lookups       | ‚úÖ Yes           | Can be multiple              |
| Clustered Index | Ordered/grouped data | ‚úÖ Yes           | Physical order matches index |
| Hash Index      | Equality search      | ‚ùå No            | Fastest for `=` queries      |
| Dense Index     | Every record         | ‚úÖ               | Faster, more space used      |
| Sparse Index    | One per block        | ‚úÖ               | Compact, slower access       |
| B+ Tree Index   | All-purpose          | ‚úÖ Yes           | Balanced, used in RDBMS      |

## ‚úÖ Final Thought

Indexing is essential for performance in modern databases. GATE DA often tests:

* **Dense vs Sparse**
* **B+ Tree vs Hash**
* **Index usage scenarios**
* Conceptual **comparisons** and small numerical cases
