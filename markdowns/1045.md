### ðŸ”¹ Topic: **Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix/List)**

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction

Graphs can be represented in memory using different data structures. The most commonly used ones in **GATE and practical scenarios** are:

* **Adjacency Matrix**
* **Adjacency List**

Each has trade-offs in terms of time complexity, space usage, and ease of traversal.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Adjacency Matrix

### âœ… Definition:

An **adjacency matrix** is a 2D array `A[N][N]` where:

* `N` is the number of vertices.
* `A[i][j] = 1` (or weight) if there is an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.
* `A[i][j] = 0` if no edge exists.

### âœ… Characteristics:

* **Undirected Graph**: Matrix is **symmetric** (`A[i][j] = A[j][i]`)
* **Directed Graph**: Matrix **may not be symmetric**
* **Weighted Graph**: Store actual weights instead of 1/0
* **Unweighted Graph**: Use 1 for presence, 0 for absence

### ðŸ“‰ Example (Unweighted Undirected Graph):

Graph:

```
V = {0, 1, 2}
Edges = {(0,1), (1,2)}
```

Adjacency Matrix:

```
    0 1 2
  --------
0 | 0 1 0
1 | 1 0 1
2 | 0 1 0
```

### ðŸ“Œ Time & Space Complexity:

| Operation                  | Complexity      |
| -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Check if edge (u,v) exists | O(1)            |
| Add/Delete edge            | O(1)            |
| Space                      | O(VÂ²)           |
| Traverse all neighbors     | O(V) per vertex |

### âœ… When to Use:

* **Dense graphs** (many edges)
* Fast edge lookup required
* Simpler matrix-based operations

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Adjacency List

### âœ… Definition:

An **adjacency list** uses an array (or dict) of lists where:

* Each index `i` stores a list of adjacent vertices to `i`

### ðŸ“‰ Example:

Same graph:

```
V = {0, 1, 2}
Edges = {(0,1), (1,2)}
```

Adjacency List:

```
0 â†’ [1]  
1 â†’ [0, 2]  
2 â†’ [1]
```

### âœ… Weighted Graph:

For weighted edges, store pairs like `(neighbor, weight)`.

Example:

```
0 â†’ [(1, 5)]  
1 â†’ [(0, 5), (2, 3)]  
2 â†’ [(1, 3)]
```

### ðŸ“Œ Time & Space Complexity:

| Operation                  | Complexity   |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Check if edge (u,v) exists | O(degree(u)) |
| Add edge                   | O(1)         |
| Space                      | O(V + E)     |
| Traverse neighbors         | O(degree(u)) |

### âœ… When to Use:

* **Sparse graphs**
* Memory-efficient storage
* Efficient neighbor traversal

| Feature                | Adjacency Matrix | Adjacency List         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Space Complexity       | O(VÂ²)            | O(V + E)               |
| Edge lookup time       | O(1)             | O(degree(u))           |
| Add/Delete edge        | O(1)             | O(1) (with lists)      |
| Best for               | Dense graphs     | Sparse graphs          |
| Traversal Time         | O(VÂ²) total      | O(V + E) total         |
| Weighted Graph Support | Yes              | Yes (with pair format) |
