#### 🔹 What is State in React?

In React, **state** refers to a component’s internal data that **changes over time** and affects what is rendered on the screen. Unlike props (which are external and read-only), **state is local and mutable** within the component.

---

#### 🔹 Why Use State?

* To manage dynamic, user-driven data
* To update the UI reactively when the data changes
* To store input values, counters, toggles, fetched results, etc.

---

#### 🔹 Defining State in Class Components

State is defined inside the class **constructor** as an object assigned to `this.state`.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }
}
```

---

#### 🔹 Updating State – `this.setState()`

You **must use** `this.setState()` to update the state. Direct mutation like `this.state.count = 1` **won’t trigger a re-render**.

```jsx
increment = () => {
  this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
};
```

> `setState()` triggers a re-render and merges the new state with the old.

---

#### 🔹 Complete Example

```jsx
class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

---

#### 🔹 State is Asynchronous

State updates may be **batched** and are **not guaranteed to be immediate**.

```jsx
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
console.log(this.state.count); // Might not show updated value
```

✅ To get the updated value, use the functional form:

```jsx
this.setState(prevState => ({
  count: prevState.count + 1
}));
```

---

#### 🔹 Initializing State from Props (with caution)

```jsx
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    name: props.initialName
  };
}
```

> ❗ Avoid this unless you really need to copy props to state. Prefer deriving directly from props in `render()`.

---

#### 🔹 Lifecycle Integration

You often use state together with **lifecycle methods**:

* `componentDidMount()` → Set initial data via API
* `componentDidUpdate()` → Act on state/prop changes
* `componentWillUnmount()` → Clear intervals or stateful logic

---

#### 🔹 Best Practices

✅ Keep state minimal and meaningful

✅ Use multiple keys in state only when logically related

✅ Don’t mutate state directly

✅ Avoid unnecessary state; derive from props/computed values if possible

---

#### 🔚 Summary

> In class components, **state is a powerful built-in feature** that stores internal mutable data and allows components to **respond to user interaction or async changes**. You update it using `this.setState()`, which triggers a re-render and keeps the UI in sync with the data.
