### DynamoDB – Fine-Grained Access Control

Fine-grained access control in DynamoDB allows precise control over which rows and attributes a user can access, ensuring security and compliance. This mechanism is especially useful for multi-tenant applications where each user or tenant should only access their own data.

Here’s an explanation of the features with an example.

---

### 1. **Using Web Identity Federation or Cognito Identity Pools**
- **What It Means**:
  - AWS **Web Identity Federation** or **Cognito Identity Pools** enables users to authenticate through third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, or Amazon) and receive temporary AWS credentials to interact with AWS services.
  - These credentials are scoped down with permissions to perform specific operations.

- **Example**:
  Imagine a mobile app where users log in using Google. Each user should only access their own data in DynamoDB. Using Cognito Identity Pools, the app assigns an IAM role that restricts DynamoDB actions based on the logged-in user's identity.

---

### 2. **IAM Roles with Conditions**
- **What It Means**:
  - You can assign an IAM role to users authenticated via Cognito Identity Pools.
  - This role has a `Condition` in the policy that enforces fine-grained access control.
  - The `Condition` ensures users can only perform actions (e.g., `GetItem`, `PutItem`) on rows where the primary key matches their identity.

- **Example Policy**:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchWriteItem"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MyTable",
            "Condition": {
                "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
                    "dynamodb:LeadingKeys": "${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `dynamodb:LeadingKeys` condition ensures the user can only access rows where the **partition key** matches their unique Cognito ID (`cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub`).

---

### 3. **LeadingKeys for Row-Level Access**
- **What It Means**:
  - The `LeadingKeys` condition in the policy restricts row-level access.
  - It matches the partition key (or primary key) of the data with the user's identity.

- **Use Case**:
  A shopping app stores orders in DynamoDB. Each row’s partition key is the user’s unique ID. The policy ensures users only access their own orders, not those of others.

---

### 4. **Attributes for Attribute-Level Access**
- **What It Means**:
  - You can further restrict which attributes (columns) users can read or write.
  - This prevents users from accessing sensitive data they shouldn’t see.

- **Use Case**:
  Suppose a table stores user information:
  ```json
  {
      "UserId": "user123",
      "Email": "user@example.com",
      "PhoneNumber": "123-456-7890",
      "SSN": "123-45-6789"
  }
  ```
  You might allow users to read their own `Email` and `PhoneNumber` but not their `SSN`.

### Complete Use Case Example

#### Scenario:
A mobile app for an e-commerce platform allows users to:
1. Log in via Google.
2. View and update their shopping cart stored in DynamoDB.

#### Steps:
1. **Authentication**:
   - The app uses Cognito Identity Pools for user authentication.
   - Each user gets a unique Cognito ID (`sub`).

2. **IAM Role with Policy**:
   - Assign a policy to the authenticated users:
     ```json
     {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
             "dynamodb:GetItem",
             "dynamodb:PutItem"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/ShoppingCart",
         "Condition": {
             "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
                 "dynamodb:LeadingKeys": "${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}"
             }
         }
     }
     ```

3. **How It Works**:
   - When a user accesses the app, their Cognito ID is passed to DynamoDB queries.
   - The IAM policy ensures they can only interact with rows where the `LeadingKeys` (partition key) matches their Cognito ID.

### Benefits:
1. **Enhanced Security**: Users only access their data.
2. **Scalability**: Works seamlessly in multi-tenant environments.
3. **Compliance**: Ensures data isolation and privacy.
