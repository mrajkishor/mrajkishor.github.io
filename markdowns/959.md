## 🔐 What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a compact, self-contained way to **securely transmit information between two parties** (usually a client and server) as a **digitally signed string**. It's widely used for **authentication**, **authorization**, and **information exchange** in modern web apps and APIs.

Think of a JWT as a **tamper-proof ID card**. Once issued, it tells the system: “This user is authenticated, and here’s what we know about them.”

---

## 🧱 Structure of a JWT

A JWT is just a long string that looks like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjM0IiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJqb2huZG9lIn0.
SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

It has **three parts**, separated by dots:

1. **Header** – Contains metadata like the algorithm used to sign the token (e.g., HS256).
2. **Payload** – The actual data (claims) such as user ID, role, or expiry time.
3. **Signature** – Created using the header, payload, and a secret key (or private key) to ensure the token is not tampered with.

All three parts are **Base64-encoded**, which makes the token URL-safe and compact, but **not encrypted**.

---

## 🧠 Important: Base64 ≠ Encryption

Many people think JWTs are "encrypted" — they’re **not**. The payload is only **encoded** using Base64, meaning:

✅ It's compressed and easy to transport
❌ But anyone can decode and read the contents

So, **never store sensitive data like passwords** in a JWT.

---

## ⚙️ How JWT Works (Auth Flow)

Here’s how JWT is commonly used in an authentication scenario:

1. **Login**:

   * A user logs in with username and password.
   * The server verifies credentials and generates a JWT.
   * This JWT contains info like `userId`, `role`, and `expiresIn`.

2. **Token Sent to Client**:

   * The token is sent back and stored by the client (in **localStorage**, **sessionStorage**, or an **HTTP-only cookie**).

3. **Subsequent Requests**:

   * The client includes the token in the `Authorization` header like this:

     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
     ```

4. **Server Validates**:

   * The server checks the JWT signature and expiration.
   * If valid, the user is authenticated, and the request is processed.
   * If not valid or expired, the server responds with `401 Unauthorized`.

## 📦 Common Use Cases

| Use Case            | How JWT Helps                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ✅ User login        | Stores login status securely on client |
| ✅ API access        | Used to protect REST APIs              |
| ✅ Role-based access | Contains roles/permissions in payload  |
| ✅ Stateless auth    | No session storage on server           |

---

## 🔐 Signing and Verification

JWTs are **signed** using a secret or a private key:

* **HMAC (HS256, HS512)** – uses a shared secret (symmetric)
* **RSA / ECDSA (RS256, ES256)** – uses a public/private key pair (asymmetric)

Only the server that has the **secret** or **private key** can issue and verify the token’s authenticity.

---

## ⏳ Token Expiry and Refresh

JWTs usually include an `exp` claim that defines when the token expires. Once expired:

* The client must **re-authenticate**, or
* Use a **refresh token** (a long-lived token stored securely) to get a new access token

This balances **security** (short-lived tokens) with **user experience** (no need to login again and again).

---

## ✅ Advantages of JWT

* 🔁 **Stateless**: No session storage required on the server
* 🌐 **Cross-domain**: Works well with APIs and microservices
* 🚀 **Compact**: Small enough to pass in HTTP headers or URLs
* 🔐 **Secure** (if implemented correctly)

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                       | Why It’s Bad                       |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Storing JWT in localStorage   | Vulnerable to XSS attacks          |
| Putting passwords in payload  | JWTs are readable (not encrypted!) |
| Not verifying JWT signatures  | Anyone can forge fake tokens       |
| Not handling token expiration | Users stay "logged in" forever     |

---

## 🧪 Real-Life JWT Example (Decoded)

```json
Header:
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

Payload:
{
  "userId": "1234",
  "username": "john.doe",
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1720700000
}
```

The `exp` is a UNIX timestamp telling when the token will expire.
The signature is a cryptographic hash — unreadable, but it ensures no tampering.

---

## 🧠 Summary: What You Should Remember

* JWT is a **secure, stateless, token-based** way to transmit user info.
* It consists of a **header**, **payload**, and **signature**.
* It’s **signed**, not encrypted. So it's safe for verification but **not for storing secrets**.
* Popular in **modern web apps** for login, role-based access, and API security.
* Always use **HTTPS**, **short expiry**, **refresh tokens**, and **secure storage**.

---

## 🔍 Is JWT vulnerable because it's only Base64 encoded?

### ✅ Yes — **anyone can read** the contents  
JWTs are **not encrypted** by default. They are just **Base64URL-encoded**, which means:

- Anyone (even an attacker) who intercepts the JWT can **decode it and read** the data inside.
- So if you store **sensitive data** like passwords, secrets, card numbers, etc., in the JWT — that’s a **serious security flaw**.

**Example:**  
```json
{
  "userId": "123",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

A middleman can decode this and see the role is `admin`. That’s bad if the server blindly trusts it.

---

## 🔐 But — JWTs are **signed**, not encrypted

While they’re not encrypted, they **are signed** using:

- A **secret key** (for `HS256`), or  
- A **private key** (for `RS256`)

This means:
- If **someone tampers** with the JWT (e.g., changes role from `"user"` to `"admin"`), the **signature will no longer match**.
- The server will detect the mismatch and **reject** the token.

So even if a middleman **reads** the token, they **can’t change or forge** a new valid one — unless they have the secret key (which should never be exposed).

---

## ⚠️ However: MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attacks are still a risk **if you don't use HTTPS**

If your site doesn't use HTTPS:
- A hacker on the same network (like public Wi-Fi) **can intercept the JWT**.
- Since JWT is often sent in the `Authorization` header or a cookie, they can **replay** that token to impersonate the user.

This is called a **token hijacking** attack.

---

## 🛡️ How to protect JWT from being misused?

| Best Practice                         | Why It Matters                              |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Use **HTTPS only**                 | Prevents token interception via sniffing    |
| ✅ Store in **HTTP-only cookies**     | Safer than localStorage (protects from XSS) |
| ✅ Set short **expiry times**         | Limits damage if a token is stolen          |
| ✅ Use **refresh tokens** securely    | Never expose long-lived tokens in frontend  |
| ✅ Validate **signatures** on server  | Prevents tampering                          |
| ✅ Add **audience, issuer, timestamp**| Prevents misuse on wrong endpoints/domains  |

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

- Yes, JWT can be **read** by anyone, but **not forged or tampered** unless they have the secret key.
- Always use **HTTPS** and **never store sensitive data** inside JWT.
- JWT is safe **only when used correctly** with proper practices.

---



## 🔐 JWTs Are **Signed**, Not Encrypted — What Does That Mean?



### 🧾 First, What's Inside a JWT?

A JWT looks like this:

```
<Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>
```

For example:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
.
eyJ1c2VyIjoiam9obiIsInJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIn0
.
dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk
```

You can decode the first two parts (Header and Payload) using any Base64 decoder.
**Nothing is secret here** — anyone can see:

```json
{
  "user": "john",
  "role": "user"
}
```

So if it's not encrypted... **what's stopping someone from changing `"role": "user"` to `"role": "admin"`?**

---

## ✅ The Answer: **The Signature**

This is where **signing** comes in.

### 🔧 What is a signature?

A **signature** is like a **digital fingerprint** that says:

> "This token was created by someone who knows the secret key — and hasn't been altered since."

It’s generated by the server like this:

```
signature = HMAC_SHA256( base64(header) + "." + base64(payload), secretKey )
```

* It uses the header + payload
* And a secret key known **only to the server**

So, if someone **changes even one letter** in the payload (e.g., role from "user" to "admin"), and then tries to send it:

* The server recalculates the expected signature based on the modified content
* It **won’t match** the signature that was sent
* ✅ So the server **rejects the token**

---

### 🔐 Why This is Secure

Because **nobody else** knows the **secret key**, they:

* Can **read** the token, but
* **Cannot recreate** a valid signature if they tamper with the data

So even if a hacker:

* Steals the token
* Decodes it
* Tries to modify the role
* Sends it back...

💥 The server will **immediately catch it** and respond with something like:

```
401 Unauthorized: Invalid signature
```

---

## 🔑 Types of Signing

### 1. **HS256 (HMAC SHA-256)** – Symmetric Signing

* A single **shared secret** is used for both:

  * Signing the token (server)
  * Verifying the token (server)

✅ Simpler, fast
⚠️ Requires secure storage of the secret on the server

---

### 2. **RS256 (RSA)** – Asymmetric Signing

* Uses a **private key** to sign
* And a **public key** to verify

✅ More secure for public APIs (only the signer needs the private key)
✅ You can give the public key to multiple services to verify tokens

---

## ❌ What Signing Doesn’t Do

> **Signing ≠ Encryption**

JWTs are still **human-readable**. For example, in dev tools or in [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/), you can paste a token and see the payload.

So **never put sensitive information** like:

* Passwords
* Bank details
* Private data

🔒 If you need to keep the contents hidden, you must **encrypt the payload** — which is **not done by default** in a normal JWT.

---

## 📦 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine:

* A JWT is like a sealed letter
* The **payload** is the content (which anyone can read)
* The **signature** is the wax seal with the official stamp

🟢 You can **read the letter**
🟢 But you **can’t reseal it with the same stamp** if you tamper with the message
🔴 So the receiver will know it's been **forged or altered**

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept         | What It Does                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 🔓 Base64       | Encodes (not encrypts) the contents |
| ✅ Signing       | Verifies authenticity + integrity   |
| ❌ No encryption | Payload is readable by anyone       |
| 🔑 Secret key   | Needed to create/verify signature   |

So JWT gives you **proof of identity and integrity**, not secrecy.

---

## Example: 

Here’s a **brief but clear explanation** of how JWT signing works with `HS256` and `RS256`, including **how to generate the keys** and example code in Node.js using the popular `jsonwebtoken` library.


## 🔑 JWT Signing Algorithms: HS256 vs RS256

---

### 🔸 1. **HS256 (HMAC SHA-256) – Symmetric Signing**

* **One shared secret key** (a simple string) is used for:

  * Signing the token when issuing
  * Verifying the token during authentication
* Both the **issuer and the verifier** must know this secret.

#### 🛠️ Secret Key Generation

```bash
# Just use a long, random string
openssl rand -hex 64
```

Example secret:

```txt
5f0b2d84c6a42a048c1a9a6d9e22610cd287eae26f9c179b92c5ee3ffb71f4a5
```

#### 🧪 Example in Node.js (HS256)

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Secret key
const secret = 'mySuperSecretKey123456';

// Create token
const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId: '123', role: 'user' }, 
  secret, 
  { algorithm: 'HS256', expiresIn: '1h' }
);

// Verify token
try {
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, secret);
  console.log('✅ Valid:', decoded);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('❌ Invalid:', err.message);
}
```

---

### 🔹 2. **RS256 (RSA) – Asymmetric Signing**

* **Two keys**:

  * **Private Key** (used to sign the token) – keep this secret
  * **Public Key** (used to verify the token) – share this with services

#### 🔐 Key Generation (with OpenSSL)

```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# Extract public key
openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem
```

This gives you:

* `private.pem` → used to sign
* `public.pem` → used to verify

#### 🧪 Example in Node.js (RS256)

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Load RSA keys
const privateKey = fs.readFileSync('private.pem');
const publicKey = fs.readFileSync('public.pem');

// Create token
const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId: '123', role: 'admin' },
  privateKey,
  { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '1h' }
);

// Verify token
try {
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, publicKey);
  console.log('✅ Verified with public key:', decoded);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('❌ Invalid token:', err.message);
}
```

> Q. ==__If the secret key is know to the middle man .. Can he hack ?__==


Yes — if a **middleman gets access to your JWT secret key**, then **yes, your entire authentication system is compromised.**

Let’s break down exactly **what can happen** and **why it’s dangerous**, especially for `HS256`:

---

## 🔥 If the secret key is exposed (HS256 case)

### A hacker can:

1. **Create fake tokens**

   * They can sign **any payload they want**, like:

     ```json
     { "userId": "123", "role": "admin" }
     ```
   * Then sign it with the secret.
   * The server will **accept it as a valid token**, because the signature matches.

2. **Bypass authentication and authorization**

   * They can impersonate **any user**, including admins.
   * They can **access protected routes, APIs, or features** they shouldn’t be allowed to.

3. **Remain undetected**

   * Since the token looks valid, the server won’t log any “invalid token” errors.
   * Unless you log all issued tokens (which defeats JWT’s stateless benefit), you won’t know it’s fake.

---

## 🧨 Real-World Example

Let’s say your JWT secret is:

```txt
mySecretKey123
```

And someone knows it. They can now generate this:

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId: '999', role: 'admin' },
  'mySecretKey123',
  { algorithm: 'HS256' }
);

// Now send this token with a request
```

Boom — they’re authenticated as admin without ever logging in.

---

## 🔐 What about RS256?

With RS256:

* The **private key signs the token**
* The **public key only verifies**

So even if someone has the **public key**, they **can’t forge a token** — they don’t have the private key.

✅ That’s why **RS256 is safer** for public APIs or multi-party systems.

---

## 🛡️ How to Protect the Secret Key?

| Do This                                   | Why                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Store it in `.env` or a secret vault    | Keeps it out of code and version control      |
| ✅ Never commit to GitHub                  | Secrets leaked in public repos = instant hack |
| ✅ Use HTTPS only                          | Prevents token sniffing via network           |
| ✅ Rotate keys periodically                | In case of accidental exposure                |
| ✅ Use RS256 for public APIs               | Safer key distribution model                  |
| ✅ Use short-lived tokens + refresh tokens | Limits what a stolen token can do             |

---

## 🧠 Summary

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| If secret key is known to hacker | ✅ Yes, they can forge and sign fake tokens       |
| Is it a big deal?                | 🚨 Yes, they can impersonate users/admins        |
| How to stop it?                  | 🔐 Keep secrets secret, use HTTPS, rotate keys   |
| Better alternative?              | 🛡️ Use RS256 to separate signing/verifying keys |

---

> Q. But in case of RS256, if the private key is known to the middle man, can he hack? 

✅ Yes — **if the RS256 private key is known to a middleman (attacker), then your system is completely compromised**, just like with HS256.

---

## 🔥 Why is the **Private Key** so critical in RS256?

In RS256 (asymmetric signing):

* The **private key** is used to **sign the JWT** (i.e., create it).
* The **public key** is used to **verify the JWT** (i.e., validate it).

So:

* If someone has the **public key**, that's **not a problem**. It’s meant to be shared.
* But if someone gets the **private key**, they can:

### ❗ Forge their own valid tokens

They can sign **any payload** (e.g., `{"role": "admin"}`), and it will pass verification on the server — because the server uses the **public key** to check the signature.

```js
// Attacker can do this:
const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId: '123', role: 'superadmin' },
  privateKey,             // stolen private key
  { algorithm: 'RS256' }
);
```

Now the server sees this token, verifies it using the public key, and says:

✅ “Yep! Signature is valid — must be authentic.”

---

## 🧨 Bottom line: If the **private key is leaked**, the attacker can:

* ✅ Create unlimited valid tokens
* ✅ Impersonate any user
* ✅ Gain full access to protected routes, admin actions, databases, etc.
* ✅ Stay undetected (because the tokens look completely legitimate)

---

## 🛡️ How to protect the RS256 **Private Key**

| Best Practice                           | Why It Matters                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 **Store in secure location**         | Use environment variables, secret managers, or key vaults |
| ❌ **Never commit to Git**               | Accidental GitHub leaks are a major real-world issue      |
| 🔐 **Use file permissions**             | Limit read access to only the app or process              |
| 🔄 **Rotate keys periodically**         | In case of leaks, rotate and re-issue keys                |
| 🌐 **Use HTTPS always**                 | Prevent man-in-the-middle access to token traffic         |
| 🔑 **Separate signing from deployment** | Use a secure signing service or auth server               |

| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can attacker hack if private key is leaked? | ✅ YES — they can create valid admin tokens               |
| Is RS256 safer than HS256?                  | ✅ Yes, **only if** the private key is safely guarded     |
| What must never be leaked?                  | 🔥 The **private key** (RS256) or the **secret** (HS256) |
| What can be shared?                         | ✅ The public key (RS256) — it’s for verification         |

---

> Q. ==Then how do RS256 is safer option. Its just architectural difference. Both are vulnerable with secret key or private key exposure. Isn't it?==

Ans:

## 🔄 HS256 and RS256 Are **Equally Vulnerable** if Secrets Are Leaked

| 🔐 Signing Algorithm | What Must Be Kept Secret         | If Leaked, What Happens?                             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **HS256** (Symmetric)| `secret key`                    | Attacker can sign fake tokens                        |
| **RS256** (Asymmetric)| `private key`                   | Attacker can sign fake tokens                        |

So yes — **in both cases**, if the **key used to sign the JWT is exposed**, an attacker can:

✅ Craft **valid tokens**  
✅ Impersonate any user  
✅ Bypass authentication  
✅ Do it undetected (tokens pass signature checks)

---

## 🧠 So Why Do People Say RS256 is "Safer"?

You're correct that **at a core level**, RS256 isn’t magically "more secure" — it just offers **better architectural control and risk isolation** in multi-service systems.

Here’s the nuanced reason:

---

### ✅ **RS256 Is Safer in Distributed or Public Systems** (Because of Key Separation)

| Feature                        | **HS256**                          | **RS256**                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 🔁 Same key for signing/verify | Yes (shared secret)                | No (separate private/public keys)     |
| 👥 Needs secret in all services| Yes — every service must know it   | No — only verifier needs public key   |
| 🔓 Public key safe to share    | ❌ No                               | ✅ Yes                                 |
| 🔐 Key exposure impact scope   | Leaks **everywhere**               | Leaks only if private key is exposed  |
| 🔐 Signer must be trusted      | Every service                      | Just the **auth server**              |

So:

- In **HS256**, any service that needs to verify a JWT also needs the secret — which means **more places to leak** it.
- In **RS256**, only **one service (auth server)** has the private key. Others get the **public key**, which is safe to share.

---

## 🔑 Analogy

Imagine:

- HS256: Everyone gets a **master key** that can lock and unlock — if any copy is lost, everything is exposed.
- RS256: Only one person has the **key to lock**, everyone else gets a **transparent box** to check if it's locked correctly. If the box is lost, no harm.

---

## ✅ When RS256 Is Safer **In Practice**

- You're exposing public APIs or working with third-party services
- You're running microservices and only want one service (auth) to generate tokens
- You want to reduce the **blast radius** of a potential key leak

---

## 🚨 Final Word: Neither Algorithm Saves You from Key Exposure

You're absolutely correct:

> "It’s just architectural difference. Both are vulnerable with secret/private key exposure."

✅ Yes — RS256 gives **safer key distribution**  
❌ But if you leak the signing key (secret for HS256, private key for RS256), you’re toast in **both** cases

So the real answer is:

> **The safety of JWT depends less on HS256 vs RS256, and more on how securely you store the key used to sign the token.**

## ⚔️ HS256 vs RS256 — When to Use What

| Scenario                              | Use HS256                             | Use RS256                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Simple app** (1 server)           | ✅ Ideal – simple and fast             | ❌ Overkill                              |
| ✅ **Monolithic backend**              | ✅ Easy to manage shared secret        | ❌ Not needed                            |
| 🔁 **Microservices**                  | ❌ Secret must be shared everywhere    | ✅ Only auth service needs private key   |
| 🌐 **Third-party token verification** | ❌ You’d share your secret             | ✅ Public key can be safely shared       |
| 👥 **Multiple token consumers**       | ❌ Risky to share secret               | ✅ Safer with public key distribution    |
| 🚀 **Public API (OAuth2, OpenID)**    | ❌ Secret exposure is dangerous        | ✅ Standard in public auth flows         |
| 🛡️ **Security-critical systems**     | ⚠️ High risk with multiple apps       | ✅ Reduced blast radius if key is leaked |
| 📱 **Mobile app consumes JWT**        | ✅ If token is only verified on server | ✅ If you distribute token to 3rd party  |

---

## 🔐 TL;DR Decision Rule:

> 🔸 Use **HS256** if your token is **only used and verified by one server** (simple apps)
> 🔹 Use **RS256** if you **share the token across services**, need public verification, or want **stronger key separation**

---

## 🧪 Examples

---

### ✅ **HS256 – Use Case: Small monolithic app**

Imagine you’re building a **simple Node.js + Express app**.

* Only **your own backend** issues and verifies the JWT.
* No other service needs to verify it.

#### ✔️ Best with HS256

```js
// Token generation
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 42 }, 'mySecret', { algorithm: 'HS256' });

// Verification
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'mySecret');
```

No need to manage multiple keys. Easy and lightweight.

---

### ✅ **RS256 – Use Case: Auth server + multiple microservices**

Let’s say:

* Your **Auth server** issues the token
* But **microservices A, B, and C** need to verify it
* You don’t want to share your secret with every microservice

#### ✔️ Best with RS256

* Auth server signs JWT with its **private key**
* Services verify JWT with **public key**

```js
// Signing (in Auth server)
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 42 }, privateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' });

// Verifying (in Service A/B/C)
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, publicKey);
```

You keep the **private key safe**, and distribute the **public key freely**. That way, even if a public service is hacked, your signing power remains secure.

---

### ✅ **RS256 – Use Case: Public OAuth2 (e.g., Google Login)**

* Google issues JWTs
* You (as a third-party app) verify them

✔️ Google uses **RS256**
✔️ You download Google’s **public key** from their JWKS endpoint
✔️ You verify JWTs **without needing Google’s secret**

This is **standard practice** in OAuth/OpenID Connect.

> Is it true ?

> Once Riemann hypothesis  is solved. I think prime numbers would be understood clearly. These algos depends on prime numbers.




## ✅ Yes — Solving the **Riemann Hypothesis** would advance our understanding of **prime numbers**.

### But:

* It **won’t magically “crack” primes**
* It **won’t immediately break encryption**
* It **doesn’t directly give new prime-finding algorithms**

Instead, it would **sharpen our understanding of the distribution of primes**, especially **how predictably they occur** along the number line.

---

## 🔍 So what *is* the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), briefly?

* It’s a famous **unsolved problem** in mathematics (one of the Clay Millennium Problems).
* It’s about the **zeros of the Riemann zeta function**, a complex-valued function that encodes deep information about **primes**.
* RH says:

  > All non-trivial zeros of the zeta function lie on the “critical line” in the complex plane, where the real part is 1/2.

Why does this matter?

Because the **zeta function is closely tied to the distribution of prime numbers** — like how dense or sparse they are.

---

## 🧠 What would solving RH mean for primes?

### It would:

* Sharpen the accuracy of existing **prime-counting formulas**

* Reduce error bounds in approximations like:

  ```math
  π(x) ≈ li(x)
  ```

  (π(x) = number of primes ≤ x)

* Help us understand **how "random" primes really are** over large scales

* Possibly influence how **pseudorandom primes** are generated in cryptographic settings

---

## 🔐 What about cryptographic algorithms (like RSA)?

Most of them **depend on primes** — but not in the way RH directly addresses.

For example:

* RSA relies on the **difficulty of factoring** a large number `n = p × q`, where `p` and `q` are large primes.
* RH doesn’t help you **find p and q given n**.
* Even if RH is proven, there’s **no known link** to making factoring easier.

So:

> ❌ **RH won’t break cryptography overnight.**
> ✅ **But** it might help **refine** or **optimize** number-theoretic algorithms in the long term.

---

## 🤔 So is your intuition wrong?

**No — your intuition is good.**
You correctly see that:

* **Prime numbers** are central to math and cryptography
* RH is **deeply tied to primes**
* Solving RH would have **ripple effects** in number theory and computational math

But the effect would be **indirect** — a breakthrough in theory, not a cheat code for prime generation or breaking encryption.

## Practical Example: 

Below is a **working demo** of both `HS256` and `RS256` JWT signing and verification using **Node.js + Express**. This will help you see **how the two approaches differ in implementation**.

---

## 🚀 Goal

You’ll get:

* 🟠 One Express API that generates and verifies **HS256** tokens
* 🔵 Another that does the same for **RS256** using key files
* 🧪 Basic frontend (React or Postman) can call and test these APIs

├── server/
│   ├── hs256.js
│   ├── rs256.js
│   ├── private.pem
│   ├── public.pem
│   └── package.json
```

---

## Step-by-Step

---

### 🔧 Step 1: Generate RSA Keys (for RS256)

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
# Generate private key (signing)
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# Generate public key (verification)
openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem
```

Place both files in the `server/` folder.

---

### 📦 Step 2: Setup `package.json`

```json
// server/package.json
{
  "name": "jwt-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "hs256.js",
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2"
  }
}
```

Run:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

---

### 🟠 Step 3: HS256 API (Symmetric JWT)

```js
// server/hs256.js
import express from 'express';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const HS_SECRET = 'mySuperSecretKey123';

app.post('/hs256/token', (req, res) => {
  const payload = { userId: 1, role: 'user' };
  const token = jwt.sign(payload, HS_SECRET, { algorithm: 'HS256', expiresIn: '1h' });
  res.json({ token });
});

app.post('/hs256/verify', (req, res) => {
  const { token } = req.body;
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, HS_SECRET);
    res.json({ valid: true, decoded });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(401).json({ valid: false, error: err.message });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('🟠 HS256 Server running on http://localhost:3000'));
```

---

### 🔵 Step 4: RS256 API (Asymmetric JWT)

```js
// server/rs256.js
import express from 'express';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import fs from 'fs';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const privateKey = fs.readFileSync('./private.pem');
const publicKey = fs.readFileSync('./public.pem');

app.post('/rs256/token', (req, res) => {
  const payload = { userId: 1, role: 'admin' };
  const token = jwt.sign(payload, privateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '1h' });
  res.json({ token });
});

app.post('/rs256/verify', (req, res) => {
  const { token } = req.body;
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, publicKey);
    res.json({ valid: true, decoded });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(401).json({ valid: false, error: err.message });
  }
});

app.listen(4000, () => console.log('🔵 RS256 Server running on http://localhost:4000'));
```
