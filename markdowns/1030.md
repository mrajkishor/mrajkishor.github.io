### 🔹 Topic: **Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)**

Linked lists are dynamic, pointer-based linear data structures made of **nodes** arranged sequentially via references (or “links”). Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory and support efficient insertions/deletions at known positions (head/tail/middle when pointer available). GATE questions commonly test **pointer manipulation**, **edge conditions (empty, single node)**, **circular variants**, and **time/space trade-offs** across singly vs doubly vs circular forms.

---

## 1. Linked List Node Model

At minimum, each node stores **data** + **link(s)** to the next (and optionally previous) node.

| Variant      | Fields in Node                       | Links | Directionality        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----- | --------------------- |
| Singly       | `data`, `next`                       | 1     | Forward only          |
| Doubly       | `data`, `prev`, `next`               | 2     | Forward & backward    |
| Circular SLL | `data`, `next` (last points to head) | 1     | Forward, wraps        |
| Circular DLL | `data`, `prev`, `next` (last ↔ head) | 2     | Bi-directional, wraps |

---

## 2. Singly Linked List (SLL)

### 2.1 Structure

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, nxt=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = nxt

class SinglyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

### 2.2 Basic Operations

#### Insert at Head (O(1))

```python
def push_front(self, x):
    self.head = Node(x, self.head)
```

#### Insert at Tail (O(n) if no tail pointer; O(1) if tail tracked)

```python
def push_back(self, x):
    if not self.head:
        self.head = Node(x)
        return
    cur = self.head
    while cur.next:
        cur = cur.next
    cur.next = Node(x)
```

#### Delete Head (O(1))

```python
def pop_front(self):
    if not self.head:
        raise IndexError("Underflow")
    val = self.head.data
    self.head = self.head.next
    return val
```

#### Delete After a Node (O(1) once node known)

```python
def delete_after(node):
    if node and node.next:
        node.next = node.next.next
```

#### Search (O(n))

Traverse until `data == key` or `None`.

---

### 2.3 Traversal Pattern

```python
cur = self.head
while cur:
    process(cur.data)
    cur = cur.next
```

---

### 2.4 Reverse a Singly Linked List (Classic GATE)

Iterative 3-pointer method:

```python
prev = None
cur = head
while cur:
    nxt = cur.next
    cur.next = prev
    prev = cur
    cur = nxt
head = prev
```

Time: O(n). Space: O(1).

---

### 2.5 Detect Cycle in SLL (Floyd’s Tortoise & Hare)

Two pointers: slow +1, fast +2. If ever equal → cycle exists. Time: O(n). Space: O(1).

---

## 3. Doubly Linked List (DLL)

Each node links **both directions**: `prev` and `next`. Supports **O(1) deletion** of a known node without prior pointer scan (unlike SLL).

### 3.1 Structure

```python
class DNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
```

### 3.2 Insert at Head

```python
def push_front(self, x):
    node = DNode(x)
    node.next = self.head
    if self.head:
        self.head.prev = node
    self.head = node
```

### 3.3 Insert After a Node

```python
def insert_after(node, x):
    if not node: return
    new = DNode(x)
    new.next = node.next
    new.prev = node
    if node.next:
        node.next.prev = new
    node.next = new
```

### 3.4 Delete Node (Pointer Given)

```python
def delete(node):
    if node.prev:
        node.prev.next = node.next
    if node.next:
        node.next.prev = node.prev
    # If deleting head, update external head pointer outside this helper.
```

> **Key advantage:** No need to traverse from head to find predecessor for deletion.

---

### 3.5 Traversal (Forward & Reverse)

Forward:

```python
cur = head
while cur:
    process(cur.data)
    cur = cur.next
```

Reverse (if tail known):

```python
cur = tail
while cur:
    process(cur.data)
    cur = cur.prev
```

---

## 4. Circular Linked Lists

In **circular variants**, the last node links back to the start, eliminating `None` at list ends and enabling **efficient rotation** and round-robin traversal.

---

### 4.1 Circular Singly Linked List (CSLL)

* Last node’s `next` points to `head`.
* Often tracked via a `tail` pointer whose `tail.next` is head — allows **O(1) insertion at end** and easy circular iteration.

#### Create 1-node CSLL:

```python
node = Node(x)
node.next = node
tail = node
```

#### Insert After Tail (Append) — O(1)

```python
def enqueue(tail, x):  # returns new tail
    node = Node(x)
    if not tail:
        node.next = node
        return node
    node.next = tail.next  # head
    tail.next = node
    return node            # new tail
```

#### Traverse n Nodes

```python
cur = tail.next  # head
while True:
    process(cur.data)
    cur = cur.next
    if cur == tail.next:
        break
```

---

### 4.2 Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL)

* Last node’s `next` → head; head’s `prev` → last.
* Supports both direction traversal in O(n).
* Used in implementations of **browser history**, **MRU caches**, and **task schedulers**.

## 5. Memory & Pointer Trade-offs

| Aspect               | SLL            | DLL                | CSLL/CDLL              |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Extra pointer / node | 1 (`next`)     | 2 (`prev`, `next`) | Same as base variant   |
| Memory overhead      | Low            | Higher             | Same + circular fixups |
| Delete given node    | Need prev scan | O(1) with pointer  | O(1) w/ pointer        |
| Bidirectional travel | No             | Yes                | Yes (CDLL only)        |
| End detection        | `None`         | `None`             | Back to start          |

---

## 6. Performance Summary

Assume external maintenance of `head` (and `tail` when helpful).

| Operation                 | SLL (w/o tail) | SLL (w/ tail) | DLL (w/ head+tail) | CSLL (tail) | CDLL (head/tail) |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Insert head               | O(1)           | O(1)          | O(1)               | O(1)\*      | O(1)             |
| Insert tail               | O(n)           | O(1)          | O(1)               | O(1)        | O(1)             |
| Delete head               | O(1)           | O(1)          | O(1)               | O(1)        | O(1)             |
| Delete tail               | O(n)           | O(n)          | O(1)               | O(n)\*\*    | O(1)             |
| Delete known node pointer | O(n)           | O(n)          | O(1)               | O(n)        | O(1)             |
| Search by value           | O(n)           | O(n)          | O(n)               | O(n)        | O(n)             |

\* Insert head in CSLL: `tail.next = newNode; newNode.next = head;` but head tracked via `tail.next`.
\*\* Unless doubly-linked circular or auxiliary backward links used.

## 7. Typical GATE Concepts & Pitfalls

| Pitfall / Concept Tested              | Explanation / What to Watch                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Null vs Circular Termination**      | In CSLL/CDLL loop ends by checking pointer equality, not `None`.                        |
| **Updating head/tail after deletion** | Forgetting to rewire causes lost sublists or memory leaks.                              |
| **Single-node edge case**             | When `head.next == head` (circular) or `head.next == None` (linear), operations differ. |
| **Shallow copies**                    | Copying head pointer copies list reference, not nodes.                                  |
| **Reversal correctness**              | Ensure last becomes head; update tail if tracked.                                       |
| **Multiple references**               | In DLL removal, update both `prev.next` and `next.prev`.                                |

## 8. Conceptual Use Cases (GATE-Relevant)

| Use Case                     | Variant Usually Used | Why                         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Stack/undo (with head)       | SLL                  | Fast head ops, low overhead |
| Browser history / navigation | DLL                  | Move back & forward         |
| Round-robin scheduling       | CSLL                 | Natural circular traversal  |
| LRU cache (hand-rolled)      | DLL + hash map       | O(1) node move/removal      |
| Polynomial addition          | SLL or C(D)LL        | Sorted insertion/traversal  |

---

## 9. Visual Pointer Snapshots (Textual)

**Singly Linked List:**
`head -> [data|*] -> [data|*] -> [data|null]`

**Doubly Linked List:**
`null <-[*|data|*]-><->[data|*]-><->[data|*]-> null`

**Circular SLL:**
`tail -> node_k -> ... -> node_1 -> node_2 -> ... -> node_k (loops back)`

---

## 10. GATE-Level Worked Mini Example

**Problem:** Insert a node with value `X` after every node containing `Y` in an SLL.

**Approach:**

1. Traverse from head.
2. If `cur.data == Y`:

   * Allocate `new = Node(X)`
   * `new.next = cur.next`
   * `cur.next = new`
   * Move `cur = new.next` to skip inserted node; avoid infinite loop on Y==X patterns.
3. Else advance normal.

Time: O(n). Space: O(1) extra per insertion.

### Final Exam Tip

In GATE, linked list questions often require **simulating pointer updates mentally**. Practice tracing operations on empty list, single-node list, two-node list, and general case. Many errors hide in these boundary conditions.
