### ðŸ”¹ What is Redux?

**Redux** is a **predictable state container** for JavaScript applications. It helps you manage **application-level (global) state** in a consistent, centralized way across your React components.

Redux is not exclusive to React â€” it can be used with any JavaScript framework or vanilla JS â€” but it's commonly paired with React for managing complex state logic.

### ðŸ”¹ Why Use Redux?

| Problem in React                | How Redux Helps                                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Prop drilling                   | Centralizes state; no need to pass deeply          |
| Sharing state across components | Global state store accessible anywhere             |
| Debugging state changes         | DevTools support time-travel debugging             |
| Predictability                  | State is updated via clear, immutable actions only |

### ðŸ”¹ Redux Core Concepts

Redux has **three core principles**:

---

### âœ… 1. **Store**

* A single JavaScript object that holds the entire state tree of your application.

```js
const store = createStore(reducer);
```

---

### âœ… 2. **Actions**

* Plain JS objects describing what happened.

```js
const addTodo = {
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  payload: 'Buy milk'
};
```

---

### âœ… 3. **Reducers**

* Pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state.

```js
function todoReducer(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [...state, action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”„ Redux Data Flow (Unidirectional)

```txt
UI â†’ dispatch(action) â†’ reducer â†’ new state â†’ UI re-renders
```

---

### ðŸ”§ Integration with React

Using **`react-redux`** package:

```bash
npm install redux react-redux
```

Wrap your app with `<Provider>`:

```js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './store';

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

---

### ðŸ”Œ Accessing Redux State and Dispatch

```js
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

const todos = useSelector(state => state.todos);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

dispatch({ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: 'Learn Redux' });
```

---

### ðŸ§  Redux Best Practices

* Keep state **serializable** and **minimal**
* Use **Redux Toolkit** to simplify setup and avoid boilerplate
* Normalize complex nested state with **entity structure**
* Keep business logic in reducers, not components

| Concept     | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Redux       | Centralized state management library      |
| Store       | Holds the global state                    |
| Actions     | Events that describe state changes        |
| Reducers    | Functions to update state immutably       |
