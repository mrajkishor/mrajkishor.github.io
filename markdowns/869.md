## 🔁 Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)

A **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** is a digital circuit used to perform the **binary addition** of two *n-bit numbers*. It consists of **n cascaded full adders**, where the **carry output of each stage ripples** into the next stage—hence the name.

---

### 🧱 **Structure**

Each full adder (FA) adds three inputs:

* Two bits of the same position from the operands (`Ai`, `Bi`)
* A carry-in (`Ci`)

And produces:

* A **sum bit** (`Si`)
* A **carry-out** (`Ci+1`), passed to the next stage.

As shown in the diagram:

```
 Cin → FA1 → FA2 → FA3 → FA4 → Cout
          ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓
         S1    S2    S3    S4
```

Each `FAi` receives `Ai`, `Bi`, and carry-in from `FA(i-1)` and outputs `Si` and carry-out to `FA(i+1)`.

### ⚙️ **Working of a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder**

Let’s add `A = 0101` and `B = 1010`.

**Bitwise Breakdown:**

| FA  | A | B | Cin | Sum Si | Cout (Carry) |
| --- | - | - | --- | ------ | ------------ |
| FA1 | 1 | 0 | 0   | 1      | 0            |
| FA2 | 0 | 1 | 0   | 1      | 0            |
| FA3 | 1 | 0 | 0   | 1      | 0            |
| FA4 | 0 | 1 | 0   | 1      | 0            |

**Result:**

* Sum = `1111`
* Carry-out = `0`

---

### 🧮 **Binary Sum and Carry Logic**

For each Full Adder:

* **Sum (Si)** = `Ai ⊕ Bi ⊕ Ci`
* **Carry-out (Ci+1)** = `Ai·Bi + (Ai ⊕ Bi)·Ci`

The carry generated at each stage **ripples** forward, affecting the timing of the result.

---

### ⚡ **Key Characteristics**

* **Propagation Delay:** Since each full adder must wait for the carry from the previous stage, RCA is slow for large bit-widths.
* **Simplicity:** Very easy to implement and understand.
* **Scalable:** Can be scaled to 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit etc., by adding more full adders.

---

### ✅ **Advantages**

* **Simple design:** Easy to construct using standard full adders.
* **Flexible:** Can handle any n-bit addition.

---

### ❌ **Disadvantages**

* **Slow speed:** The output is delayed due to carry ripple through each adder stage.
* **Not optimal for high-speed systems.**

---

### 🧠 **Improvement Over RCA**

To reduce propagation delay, **Carry Look-Ahead Adders (CLA)** or **Carry Save Adders (CSA)** are used in modern digital systems.
