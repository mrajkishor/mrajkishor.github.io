# 📦 Route Grouping in Express.js: Organizing Routes for Scalable Applications

As your Express.js application grows, managing all your routes in a single file becomes unwieldy. That’s where **Route Grouping** comes in. It helps you organize routes by features or modules, making your code more readable, maintainable, and scalable.

---

## 🧠 What is Route Grouping?

**Route Grouping** refers to the practice of logically organizing related routes under a common path prefix or within modular files using `express.Router()`. While Express doesn’t support “grouping” like Laravel or Fastify natively, it provides a flexible API that allows for manual grouping using routers.

---

## 🛠️ Why Use Route Grouping?

* ✅ Improves **code structure**
* ✅ Encourages **modular design**
* ✅ Makes it easier to apply **middleware** to route groups
* ✅ Simplifies **versioning** of APIs (e.g., `/api/v1`)

---

## 🧪 Basic Example Without Grouping

```js
app.get('/users', getUsers);
app.get('/users/:id', getUserById);
app.post('/users', createUser);
```

When all routes are defined in one file, it becomes hard to maintain as more features are added.

## 📂 Modular Route Grouping with `express.Router()`

### 🧱 Step 1: Create a Router

```js
// routes/userRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('All users'));
router.get('/:id', (req, res) => res.send(`User ${req.params.id}`));
router.post('/', (req, res) => res.send('Create user'));

module.exports = router;
```

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Use the Router in the Main App

```js
// app.js or index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');

app.use('/users', userRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running'));
```

Now:

* `GET /users` → returns all users
* `GET /users/123` → returns user with ID 123
* `POST /users` → creates a new user

---

## 🛡️ Middleware on Route Groups

You can apply middleware to specific route groups:

```js
app.use('/admin', authenticateAdmin, adminRoutes);
```

All `/admin` routes will now pass through `authenticateAdmin` middleware.

---

## 🗂 Recommended Folder Structure

```
project/
│
├── routes/
│   ├── userRoutes.js
│   ├── productRoutes.js
│   └── orderRoutes.js
│
├── controllers/
│   ├── userController.js
│   └── ...
│
└── app.js
```

This structure helps you separate concerns cleanly.

---

## 🚀 Grouping for API Versioning

```js
app.use('/api/v1/users', require('./routes/userRoutes'));
app.use('/api/v2/users', require('./routes/userRoutesV2'));
```

This makes your app ready for future enhancements without breaking old APIs.

## ✅ Summary

| Feature             | Benefit                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `express.Router()`  | Isolates route logic per module                   |
| `app.use()`         | Mounts grouped routes under a common path prefix  |
| Middleware Grouping | Attach auth, logging, or error handlers per group |
| API Versioning      | Separate route logic by version                   |

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

Route grouping isn’t just a pattern—it’s a **best practice** in large-scale Node.js apps using Express. It keeps your codebase **modular**, **testable**, and **ready to scale**. If you’re still putting all routes in one file, it’s time to refactor and group!
