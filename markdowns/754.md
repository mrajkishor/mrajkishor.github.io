Given 


```js


why it prints in reverse


import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("parent");
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {" "}
      <Child1 />{" "}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

const Child1 = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("child 1");
  }, []);
  return (
    <div>
      {" "}
      <Child2 />{" "}
    </div>
  );
};

const Child2 = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("child 2");
  }, []);
  return <div> content of child 2 </div>;
};

```

### ✅ Output in Console:

```
child 2
child 1
parent
```

### 📘 Explanation: Why It Prints in Reverse

React renders **children components first**, then moves **up the tree** to the parent for `useEffect()` execution. This happens because:

* React **renders the entire tree top-down** (i.e., `App → Child1 → Child2`)
* But **`useEffect()` runs *after* rendering**, and it runs **bottom-up**, starting from the deepest child:

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Flow:

1. `App` renders → calls `<Child1 />`
2. `Child1` renders → calls `<Child2 />`
3. `Child2` renders → React completes rendering the full tree
4. Now React starts running `useEffect()`:

   * `Child2`'s `useEffect()` runs first → logs `"child 2"`
   * Then `Child1`'s `useEffect()` → logs `"child 1"`
   * Then `App`'s `useEffect()` → logs `"parent"`

---

### 🧠 Key Note:

* `useEffect()` is **asynchronous** and **runs after DOM painting**, **not during rendering**
* Effects run **after the entire render phase completes**, and React executes them in the **child-to-parent order** (reverse of render)

This behavior ensures **children are fully initialized before parents react to them**, helpful in **synchronizing effects** across nested components.


----

React runs `useEffect()` **from child to parent (reverse order)** because:


### 🧠 **Reason: Ensures All Children Are Mounted Before Effects Run**

When React finishes rendering the component tree:

1. **DOM for all children is ready**
2. Only then it runs side effects (`useEffect`)
3. It runs effects **from deepest child up to parent**, to make sure:

   * **Parents don’t react to something before children are ready**
   * This avoids errors like a parent trying to access a ref or state of a child that hasn’t initialized yet

---

### 📌 Think of it like:

> “Render top-down, run side effects bottom-up.”

---

### 🔧 Practical Example:

Suppose a parent tries to read a value from a child via a `ref` in `useEffect`.
If React ran the parent’s `useEffect` first, the child’s DOM wouldn't exist yet.
Running children’s `useEffect` first ensures everything is mounted and safe to interact with.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

React uses **bottom-up `useEffect()` execution** to **preserve correctness, prevent race conditions**, and ensure the full component tree is ready before any parent performs logic depending on its children.
