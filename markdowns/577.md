# 📍 Bellman-Ford Algorithm – Handle Negative Weights & Detect Cycles

The **Bellman-Ford algorithm** is a powerful graph algorithm used to find the **shortest paths from a single source** to all other vertices in a **weighted graph**, especially when **negative weights** are involved.

While **Dijkstra's algorithm fails** with negative weights, Bellman-Ford handles them **gracefully** and even detects **negative weight cycles**.

## 🎯 Key Features

* Works for **directed** or **undirected** graphs.
* Handles **negative edge weights**.
* Can **detect negative weight cycles** (if reachable from the source).
* Slower than Dijkstra’s but more robust.

---

## 🧠 Core Intuition

The algorithm is based on **edge relaxation**:

> "If the shortest path to `u` is known, and `v` is a neighbor via edge `u → v` with weight `w`,
> then `dist[v]` can be updated as `dist[v] = min(dist[v], dist[u] + w)`."

It does this **|V| - 1 times** (where V = number of vertices), which is enough to ensure all shortest paths are found.

Then, on the **V-th iteration**, if any edge still improves the distance → there’s a **negative cycle**.

## 📦 When to Use Bellman-Ford

| Situation                                                            | Use Bellman-Ford?          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Graph has **negative weights**                                       | ✅ Yes                      |
| Graph has **negative weight cycles** and you want to **detect them** | ✅ Yes                      |
| All weights are **non-negative**                                     | ❌ Prefer Dijkstra (faster) |

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. Initialize all `dist[] = ∞`, except `dist[src] = 0`
2. Repeat `(V - 1)` times:

   * For every edge `(u → v, weight)`, try to **relax**:
     `if dist[u] + weight < dist[v] → update dist[v]`
3. One final pass over all edges:

   * If you can still relax any edge → **negative cycle detected**

## 💻 Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

class Edge {
    int from, to, weight;
    Edge(int f, int t, int w) {
        from = f; to = t; weight = w;
    }
}

public class BellmanFord {
    public static int[] bellmanFord(List<Edge> edges, int V, int src) {
        int[] dist = new int[V];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[src] = 0;

        // Step 1: Relax edges V-1 times
        for (int i = 0; i < V - 1; i++) {
            for (Edge e : edges) {
                if (dist[e.from] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dist[e.from] + e.weight < dist[e.to]) {
                    dist[e.to] = dist[e.from] + e.weight;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Check for negative-weight cycles
        for (Edge e : edges) {
            if (dist[e.from] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dist[e.from] + e.weight < dist[e.to]) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Graph contains a negative weight cycle");
            }
        }

        return dist;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int V = 5;
        List<Edge> edges = Arrays.asList(
            new Edge(0, 1, 2),
            new Edge(0, 2, 4),
            new Edge(1, 2, -3),
            new Edge(1, 3, 7),
            new Edge(2, 4, 3),
            new Edge(3, 4, -1)
        );

        int[] distances = bellmanFord(edges, V, 0);
        System.out.println("Shortest distances from source 0:");
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            System.out.println("To " + i + " = " + distances[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

## 📉 Time & Space Complexity

| Aspect | Value        |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Time   | **O(V × E)** |
| Space  | O(V)         |

* V = number of vertices
* E = number of edges

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

Graph:

```
0 → 1 (2)  
0 → 2 (4)  
1 → 2 (-3)  
1 → 3 (7)  
2 → 4 (3)  
3 → 4 (-1)
```

* After 1st iteration:
  `dist[2]` becomes `-1` via path `0 → 1 → 2`

* After 2nd iteration:
  `dist[4]` updates via `2 → 4`

---

## ⚠️ Negative Weight Cycles

If any edge still relaxes after `V - 1` iterations, it means:

> "The path can be **improved infinitely** by going through a cycle → the cycle has **negative weight**."

This is how Bellman-Ford detects them.

## 🧠 Dijkstra vs Bellman-Ford

| Time Complexity      | O((V + E) log V)              | O(V × E)                |
| Best For             | Fast on dense/positive graphs | Robust on tricky graphs |

## ✅ Final Tips

* Use **Dijkstra** when all weights are non-negative and performance matters.
* Use **Bellman-Ford** when:

  * Weights can be negative.
  * You need to **detect negative cycles**.
* Don’t forget the final **cycle check** after `V-1` relaxations.
