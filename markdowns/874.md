## 🧮 Number Systems

A **number system** is a structured method to represent, interpret, and perform operations on numbers. Computers and digital systems rely heavily on different number systems for internal processing, data storage, and arithmetic operations.

There are four commonly used number systems in computer science:

---

### 🔟 1. Decimal Number System (Base-10)

* **Digits Used**: 0 to 9
* **Base**: 10
* **Structure**: It’s a *positional value system*, meaning each digit’s position is associated with a power of 10.

**Example:**

```
734 = 7×10² + 3×10¹ + 4×10⁰ = 700 + 30 + 4
207 = 2×10² + 0×10¹ + 7×10⁰ = 200 + 0 + 7
971 = 9×10² + 7×10¹ + 1×10⁰ = 900 + 70 + 1
```

### 💡 2. Binary Number System (Base-2)

* **Digits Used**: 0 and 1
* **Base**: 2
* **Used In**: All modern digital systems and computers
* **Structure**: Positional system with powers of 2 from right to left.

Each **bit** (binary digit) represents a power of 2.
The **MSB** (most significant bit) is on the left, and the **LSB** (least significant bit) is on the right.

**Example:**

```
Binary: 11010₂  
Decimal: = 1×2⁴ + 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 0×2⁰
        = 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 26₁₀
```

*Image Explanation:*
The image showing blocks marked `2⁵` to `2⁰` visually demonstrates how each bit contributes to the total value based on its position.

### 8️⃣ 3. Octal Number System (Base-8)

* **Digits Used**: 0 to 7
* **Base**: 8
* **Structure**: Positional value system using powers of 8

**Example:**

```
Octal: 726₈  
Decimal: = 7×8² + 2×8¹ + 6×8⁰ = 448 + 16 + 6 = 470₁₀
```

---

### 🧮 4. Hexadecimal Number System (Base-16)

* **Digits Used**: 0–9, A–F
  (A = 10, B = 11, ..., F = 15)
* **Base**: 16
* **Structure**: Positional system using powers of 16

**Example:**

```
Hex: 27FB₁₆  
Decimal: = 2×16³ + 7×16² + F×16¹ + B×16⁰
        = 2×4096 + 7×256 + 15×16 + 11×1
        = 8192 + 1792 + 240 + 11 = 10235₁₀
```

### 🎯 Summary Table:

| Number System | Base | Digits Used | Positional Base | Example        |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Decimal       | 10   | 0–9         | 10              | 734 = 700+30+4 |
| Binary        | 2    | 0, 1        | 2               | 11010 = 26     |
| Octal         | 8    | 0–7         | 8               | 726 = 470      |
| Hexadecimal   | 16   | 0–9, A–F    | 16              | 27FB = 10235   |
