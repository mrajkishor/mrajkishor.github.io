### 📌 Types of System Calls

System calls are grouped into categories based on the **kind of service** they provide to user programs. Each type serves a specific purpose in enabling the OS to manage processes, files, devices, and communication.

Let’s go through the most important types — with examples that are **GATE-relevant** and also practical.

---

## 1️⃣ Process Control

These system calls are used to **create**, **terminate**, and **manage** processes.

🔧 **Examples**:

* `fork()` – create a new child process (copy of parent)
* `exec()` – replace current process with a new program
* `exit()` – terminate a process
* `wait()` – wait for a child process to finish
* `getpid()` – get process ID

🔍 **GATE Tip**:

* `fork()` returns **0 to child**, and **PID of child to parent**

---

## 2️⃣ File Management

Used for **working with files**: opening, reading, writing, and closing them.

📁 **Examples**:

* `open()` – open a file
* `read()` – read data from a file
* `write()` – write data to a file
* `close()` – close an open file
* `lseek()` – reposition read/write pointer
* `unlink()` – delete a file

📌 Behind the scenes:

* File descriptors (like `fd=3`) are returned and used for future file operations.

---

## 3️⃣ Device Management

Controls **hardware devices** like keyboards, disks, and printers.

🖨️ **Examples**:

* `ioctl()` – device-specific operations (I/O control)
* `read()` / `write()` – used here too (e.g., reading from disk or USB)
* `open()` / `close()` – also used to access devices

📌 Devices are treated as **special files** in UNIX.

---

## 4️⃣ Information Maintenance

Used to query or update information about the system or current process.

📊 **Examples**:

* `getpid()` – process ID of current process
* `getppid()` – parent’s process ID
* `alarm()` – set a timer
* `time()` – current system time
* `sleep()` – pause execution

⏱️ GATE sometimes tests behavior of alarms and sleep with multiple processes.

---

## 5️⃣ Communication (Inter-Process Communication)

Used for **transferring data** between processes.

🔗 **Examples**:

* `pipe()` – create a communication channel between processes
* `shmget()` – create shared memory segment
* `mmap()` – memory-mapped file for shared memory
* `send()` / `recv()` – send/receive over a socket
* `socket()` – create a network socket

📌 IPC is key for concurrent systems and **multi-process architecture**.

---

## 6️⃣ Protection and Security (less commonly asked in GATE)

Used to manage **access rights** and control user permissions.

🔐 **Examples**:

* `chmod()` – change file permissions
* `setuid()` – change user ID (for privilege control)

### 💡 Summary Table

| **Type**                | **Purpose**                     | **Examples**                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Process Control         | Create/exit/manage processes    | `fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()`, `wait()`   |
| File Management         | File operations                 | `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()` |
| Device Management       | Access/Control I/O devices      | `ioctl()`, `read()`, `write()`           |
| Information Maintenance | Get/set process/system info     | `getpid()`, `alarm()`, `time()`          |
| Communication           | Data exchange between processes | `pipe()`, `shmget()`, `send()`           |

---

### 🧠 GATE Insights

* `fork()` + `exec()` patterns are frequently tested.
* MCQs might give syscall sequences and ask for **final output or process tree**.
* Know how **file descriptors** behave in concurrent processes.

### 📝 Final Note

System calls are like the **API between user programs and the OS**.
Each type is designed for a specific class of OS services.
Understanding them helps in debugging, optimizing, and building secure systems.
