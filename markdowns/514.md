# ⚡ Static Site Generation (SSG) for Performance in Next.js

## 🧭 Introduction

When it comes to building fast, scalable web applications, **Static Site Generation (SSG)** is a powerful technique. In Next.js, SSG allows you to pre-render pages **at build time**, resulting in **blazing-fast load speeds**, **better SEO**, and **reduced server costs**.

This post explores what SSG is, how it works in Next.js, and how to implement it effectively for maximum performance benefits.

## 📖 What is Static Site Generation?

**SSG** is a rendering strategy where pages are generated **once at build time** and served as static HTML/CSS/JS files via a CDN. This approach is ideal for content that doesn’t change frequently — such as blogs, documentation, landing pages, or marketing websites.

## 🚀 Benefits of SSG

| Feature                     | Benefit                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 🏎️ Lightning-fast loading   | HTML is pre-built and served instantly     |
| 🔄 No runtime processing     | Reduced server load and zero latency       |
| 🌍 SEO-friendly             | HTML is crawlable by search engines        |
| 💰 Cost-effective           | Works great with static hosting/CDNs       |
| 🔐 Secure                   | No database or backend exposed at runtime  |

## ⚙️ How SSG Works in Next.js

In Next.js, SSG is powered by:

```js
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      data: ...
    }
  };
}
```

- This runs **at build time**, not on every request.
- The output is **static HTML + minimal JS**.

Optionally, you can pair it with:

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [...],
    fallback: false // or true / "blocking"
  };
}
```

This is used for **dynamic routes** like `/blog/[slug]`.

## 🧪 Example: Blog Page with SSG

```js
// pages/blog/[slug].js

import { getAllPosts, getPostBySlug } from '../../lib/api';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = getAllPosts(); // Fetch list of slugs
  return {
    paths: posts.map(post => ({ params: { slug: post.slug } })),
    fallback: false,
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = getPostBySlug(params.slug);
  return {
    props: { post },
  };
}

export default function BlogPost({ post }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

## 🔁 When Should You Use SSG?

| Use Case                     | SSG?    |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Blog or documentation       | ✅ Yes  |
| Marketing or landing pages  | ✅ Yes  |
| Product pages with little change | ✅ Yes  |
| Highly dynamic data (user dashboard, auth) | ❌ No (use SSR or CSR) |

---

## 🧠 Tips for Optimizing SSG

- Use `revalidate` for periodic regeneration (ISR):
  ```js
  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 60, // Rebuild page every 60s
  };
  ```
- Keep page payloads small
- Optimize images using `next/image`
- Use CDN hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare)

## 🧱 Comparison: SSG vs SSR vs CSR

| Feature         | SSG                  | SSR                     | CSR                     |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Render Timing   | At build time        | At request time          | On client after load     |
| Speed           | 🏆 Fastest           | Slower (server response) | Slowest (JS-only load)   |
| SEO             | ✅ Excellent         | ✅ Excellent              | ⚠️ Poor if not preloaded |
| Best For        | Blogs, docs, landing | Auth pages, dashboards   | Apps with dynamic UIs    |
