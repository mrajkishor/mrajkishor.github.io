### 🕐 Case Study: WhatIsTheTime.com – Architecting a Stateless Web App from Scratch

Welcome to the journey of building and evolving a stateless web application — **WhatIsTheTime.com** — a simple app that tells users the current time. While it sounds basic, this case is a great lens through which we can understand how real solutions scale, evolve, and become resilient.

---

### ✅ Initial Requirements

Here’s what the business team says:

* “We don’t need a database — just return the time.”
* “We want to **start small**, and it’s okay if the app **goes down occasionally**.”
* “Later, we want to scale it **vertically and horizontally** without downtime.”
* “Eventually, the system should handle **disasters**, **scale automatically**, and be **cost-effective**.”

This is the perfect use case for learning **stateless web app architecture** with cloud-native best practices.

---

### 🔹 Phase 1: Starting Simple (Single EC2)

We begin with the **bare minimum setup**:

* **A single EC2 instance** (e.g., T2.micro) running our app.
* It’s assigned a **public IP (Elastic IP)** so users can access it.
* The EC2 serves static or dynamic content — e.g., “The time is 5:30 PM.”

**Pros:**

* Easy to deploy and understand.
* Perfect for prototypes or MVPs.

**Cons:**

* Not scalable.
* Any reboot or crash = **total downtime**.
* Manual management required.

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Vertical Scaling (Upgrade EC2)

Traffic grows. So we try to handle it by **resizing the instance** from T2 to M5 (larger compute power).

**What’s the problem?**

* **Vertical scaling = downtime**. When you stop the server to resize, users can’t reach the app.
* It’s also **limited** — you can only go as big as AWS allows.

This is why real-world architectures avoid vertical-only scaling.

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Horizontal Scaling (Multiple EC2s)

We now run **multiple EC2 instances** (all running the same app code):

* Each instance can serve some of the traffic.
* But now we **drop Elastic IP** and instead rely on **Route 53** (AWS DNS service).
* We create a DNS “A Record” for `api.whatisthetime.com` pointing to each EC2 IP.

**Problem:**

* Without a **load balancer**, DNS round-robin isn’t reliable.
* If an instance crashes, Route 53 may still direct traffic there.
* TTL (Time-to-Live) makes DNS records **slow to update** in failure scenarios.

---

### 🧠 Concepts Introduced So Far

* **Public IP vs Private IP**:

  * Public IP (Elastic) = accessible from internet.
  * Private IP = used internally (e.g., in a VPC).
* **Elastic IP**: Static public IP that sticks with the instance.
* **Route 53 DNS**:

  * **A Record** = IP-to-domain binding.
  * **Alias Record** = points to AWS services like ELB.
  * **TTL** = how long DNS results are cached (1 hour = delay in reacting to failures).

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Load Balancer + Health Checks

Now we add an **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:

* ELB gets a DNS Alias via Route 53.
* ELB performs **health checks** on EC2s and routes traffic only to healthy ones.
* Our EC2s are now **private** (not exposed directly to internet).
* Only the **ELB is public-facing**, increasing **security**.

We also apply **Security Group rules**:

* EC2 only accepts traffic from the ELB (not directly from outside).
* The ELB accepts requests from the internet.

This increases **resilience**, **security**, and **operational visibility**.

---

### 🔹 Phase 5: Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

To avoid manually managing EC2s, we define an **Auto Scaling Group**:

* ASG keeps **a minimum number of instances running**.
* It can scale **out** (add more EC2s on high traffic) and **in** (remove during low usage).
* ELB and ASG integrate seamlessly.

**Bonus Tip:**
We can configure ASG to span **multiple availability zones (AZs)** for high availability.

---

### 🔹 Phase 6: Multi-AZ for Fault Tolerance

What if a full **Availability Zone fails**? (e.g., AWS has hardware issues in one AZ)

Our ASG is now configured to span:

* **AZ1, AZ2, AZ3** — each with EC2s.
* ELB distributes traffic across them using **round-robin and health checks**.

If **AZ2 fails**, the ASG launches EC2s in AZ1 and AZ3. The system **self-heals**.

---

### 🔹 Phase 7: Capacity Reservation & Cost Savings

Finally, we optimize costs:

* Set **minimum capacity** in ASG.
* Use **Reserved Instances** for this base capacity — giving up to **75% discount** over On-Demand pricing.
* This ensures **predictable performance** and **budget control**.
