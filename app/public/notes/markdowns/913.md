# ⚠️ **Error Handling and Retrying Strategies**

No matter how elegant your UI is, **failure is inevitable** — especially in real-world, distributed systems. APIs can go down, users can lose internet, auth tokens can expire, and services might timeout.

When you're building frontend apps at scale — like at Meta, Netflix, or Amazon — handling errors gracefully is a **must**. This includes:

* Showing appropriate fallback UI
* Retrying operations intelligently
* Escalating or recovering from failure
* Logging/reporting errors to monitoring tools

This is where Redux-Saga gives you a ton of power to handle such scenarios declaratively.

Let’s break it all down — like a seasoned dev would do it.

## 🧠 Core Ideas of Error Handling in Redux-Saga

Redux-Saga follows the **try-catch-finally** style error control using generator functions.

Key goals:

* Catch **runtime errors** in async flows
* Notify the app through Redux actions
* Retry transient failures with a backoff strategy
* Prevent cascading failures

---

## ✅ Basic Error Handling with `try/catch`

### 🔧 Example

```js
function* fetchUserSaga(action) {
  try {
    const data = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.payload);
    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_SUCCESS", payload: data });
  } catch (error) {
    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_FAILED", error: error.message });
  }
}
```

### 🔍 How It Works

* If `call()` throws (network error, 500, etc.), control jumps to the `catch` block
* You can **dispatch a failure action** so the reducer can update the UI accordingly

---

## 🔁 Retrying Failed Requests with `retry`

Redux-Saga offers a built-in `retry()` utility that simplifies retry logic.

### 🔧 Example

```js
import { retry } from "redux-saga/effects";

function* fetchUserSaga(action) {
  try {
    const data = yield retry(3, 2000, api.fetchUser, action.payload);
    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_SUCCESS", payload: data });
  } catch (error) {
    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_FAILED", error: error.message });
  }
}
```

### 🧠 What Happens Here:

* Tries up to **3 times**
* Waits **2 seconds** between attempts
* If all fail, catches the error and dispatches a failure action

This is great for **flaky networks**, **rate-limited APIs**, or **temporary server hiccups**.

---

## ⏳ Timeout Protection using `race()`

You don’t want your UI to hang forever waiting for a request.

```js
import { call, put, race, delay } from "redux-saga/effects";

function* fetchWithTimeout(action) {
  try {
    const { response, timeout } = yield race({
      response: call(api.fetchUser, action.payload),
      timeout: delay(5000),
    });

    if (timeout) {
      throw new Error("Request timed out");
    }

    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_SUCCESS", payload: response });
  } catch (err) {
    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_FAILED", error: err.message });
  }
}
```

### 🔥 Pattern Highlights:

* `race()` lets you "race" your request against a timeout
* If timeout wins, treat it as an error
* Helps prevent **slow-loading spinners** and **poor UX**

---

## 🚫 Cancel a Request on User Action

```js
import { call, take, fork, cancel } from "redux-saga/effects";

function* uploadWorker(file) {
  try {
    yield call(api.uploadFile, file);
    yield put({ type: "UPLOAD_SUCCESS" });
  } catch (err) {
    yield put({ type: "UPLOAD_FAILED", error: err.message });
  }
}

function* watchUpload() {
  while (true) {
    const { payload } = yield take("UPLOAD_REQUEST");
    const task = yield fork(uploadWorker, payload);

    const action = yield take(["UPLOAD_CANCEL", "UPLOAD_SUCCESS", "UPLOAD_FAILED"]);

    if (action.type === "UPLOAD_CANCEL") {
      yield cancel(task);
      yield put({ type: "UPLOAD_CANCELED" });
    }
  }
}
```

This gives the user the power to cancel an ongoing operation and keeps the app responsive.

---

## 🛡️ Global Error Catching with `onError`

You can globally catch **unhandled saga errors** at the middleware level:

```js
const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware({
  onError: (error, { sagaStack }) => {
    console.error("Unhandled saga error:", error, sagaStack);
    // Report to Sentry, Datadog, etc.
  },
});
```

Perfect for crash reporting tools like **Sentry**, **NewRelic**, or **LogRocket**.

---

## 🧪 Testing Failure Cases in Sagas

```js
import { call, put } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { fetchUser } from "../api/user";
import { fetchUserSaga } from "../sagas/userSaga";

test("handles fetch failure", () => {
  const action = { payload: 123 };
  const gen = fetchUserSaga(action);

  expect(gen.next().value).toEqual(call(fetchUser, 123));

  const error = new Error("Failed to fetch");
  expect(gen.throw(error).value).toEqual(
    put({ type: "FETCH_USER_FAILED", error: "Failed to fetch" })
  );
});
```

## ✅ Enterprise-Level Best Practices

| Strategy                  | Why It's Critical                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `try/catch` in every saga | Don’t let unhandled rejections crash your app |
| Use `retry()`             | Auto-recover from flaky errors                |
| Timeout with `race()`     | Protect user experience from hanging forever  |
| Use `cancel()`            | Allow aborting long-running flows             |
| Dispatch failure actions  | So reducers and UI know how to respond        |
| Use global `onError`      | For logging unhandled errors                  |
| Always test failure paths | Write tests for errors, not just happy paths  |

---

## 🎯 Example: Retry with Backoff (Custom)

```js
function* retryWithBackoff(fn, args, maxTries = 3, delayMs = 1000) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxTries; i++) {
    try {
      return yield call(fn, ...args);
    } catch (err) {
      if (i < maxTries - 1) yield delay(delayMs * (i + 1)); // increasing delay
      else throw err;
    }
  }
}
```

Use this when you want exponential backoff or more control than `retry()` gives.

## 🔚 Summary

| Tool        | Purpose                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `try/catch` | Wrap API logic and catch failures       |
| `retry()`   | Retry flaky or temporary failures       |
| `race()`    | Timeout protection or task competition  |
| `cancel()`  | Stop long-running requests like uploads |
| `onError`   | Global crash/error reporting            |
| Tests       | Simulate errors and validate saga logic |

## 💡 Final Thoughts

In interviews and production, **handling failure well is a superpower**. It shows you're not just writing happy-path code — you're designing resilient systems.

Engineers at Enterprise do this **by default**. Their code:

* Retries when appropriate
* Fails gracefully
* Keeps the user informed
* Recovers quickly
