## **2.1 Operating-System Services**

An OS provides a set of **services** to programs and users. These services can be grouped into two perspectives:

### **1. User-Oriented Services** *(make the system easier to use)*
- **User Interface (UI):**  
  - **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – Text commands (e.g., Bash, PowerShell).  
  - **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** – Windows, icons, menus, pointing devices.  
  - **Touchscreen Interface** – Common in mobiles/tablets.
- **Program Execution:** Load a program into memory, run it, terminate normally or abnormally (error).
- **I/O Operations:** OS provides uniform I/O handling; hides device-specific details.
- **File-System Manipulation:** Create, read, write, search, delete files/directories.
- **Communication:** Between processes (IPC) via shared memory or message passing; between systems via networking.
- **Error Detection:** OS constantly monitors for hardware errors, resource exhaustion, software bugs.

### **2. System-Oriented Services** *(ensure efficient & safe operation)*
- **Resource Allocation:** CPU, memory, devices allocated fairly.
- **Accounting:** Track resource usage for billing/statistics.
- **Protection & Security:** Prevent unauthorized access to resources; secure data from malicious attacks.

## **2.2 User and Operating-System Interface**

Interaction between **user ↔ OS** happens through **interfaces**:

### **1. Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
- **Pros:** Powerful, scriptable, low overhead.
- **Cons:** Requires learning commands/syntax.
- **Examples:** UNIX shell, Windows CMD, PowerShell.

### **2. Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- Mouse/keyboard/touch driven.
- **Pros:** Intuitive, user-friendly.
- **Cons:** Higher resource usage.

### **3. Touchscreen Interface**
- Tap, swipe, multi-touch gestures.
- Optimized for mobile devices.

## **2.3 System Calls**

System calls are the **programming interface** to the OS — a controlled way for programs to request services from the kernel.

**Key Points:**
- Usually accessed via high-level API (e.g., C library) instead of calling directly.
- Implemented as **software interrupts/traps** to switch to kernel mode.
- Common in C: `read()`, `write()`, `fork()`, `exec()`.
- Each system call has:
  1. **Number** (for OS to identify service)
  2. **Parameters** (passed via registers, memory blocks, or stack)

**Example Flow:**
1. App calls `write(fd, buffer, nbytes)`.
2. Library routine sets up registers with parameters & system call number.
3. Executes **trap** instruction to switch to kernel mode.
4. OS kernel verifies request → performs service.
5. Control returns to user mode.

## **2.4 Types of System Calls**

Grouped by functionality:

1. **Process Control**
   - Create/terminate process: `fork()`, `exit()`
   - Load new program: `exec()`
   - Wait for process: `waitpid()`
   - Get/set attributes.

2. **File Manipulation**
   - Create, open, close, read, write, delete files.
   - Change file attributes/permissions.

3. **Device Manipulation**
   - Request/release device.
   - Read/write device.
   - Get/set device attributes.

4. **Information Maintenance**
   - Get system date/time, OS version.
   - Get/set process attributes.
   - Profiling/statistics.

5. **Communications**
   - **Message Passing:** Send/receive messages via mailbox or ports.
   - **Shared Memory:** Create, attach, detach memory regions.

## **2.5 System Programs**

Also called **system utilities** — they are not part of the kernel, but provide **convenient environment** for program development and execution.

**Categories:**
1. **File Management** – Copy, move, delete, list files.
2. **Status Information** – Date, time, system usage, logged-in users.
3. **File Modification** – Editors, filters.
4. **Programming Tools** – Compilers, linkers, debuggers.
5. **Program Execution** – Loaders, job control.
6. **Communication** – Mail, chat, file transfer utilities.

## **GATE Exam Pointers**
- **System call vs API:** GATE likes to test that **system call** is the OS entry point, API is language-specific convenience wrapper.
- Know **types of system calls** and examples.
- Common MCQ: "Which of these is NOT a system call?" (trick: `printf` is NOT a system call; it eventually calls `write`).
- **Trap instruction** is crucial — causes mode switch.
- **CLI vs GUI** pros/cons can appear in theory questions.
