Hereâ€™s a polished and concise response for the HR/Technical interview question:

### ðŸ’¬ **Question: "Can you explain your recent project?"**

---

### âœ… **Answer:**

Sure! My most recent project was **Automated Customer Support System (ACSS)** for **Verizon**, where I worked as a **Full Stack Developer** from December 2023 to November 2024.

ACSS is a representative-facing platform that integrates various Verizon systems to help customer support agents resolve user issues â€” whether itâ€™s billing, plan changes, or technical queries. Itâ€™s deeply integrated with Verizon's CTI system for routing calls and allows reps to fetch user data, escalate to supervisors, or resolve most queries directly.

On the **frontend**, I worked extensively with **React, Redux Toolkit, Redux-Saga**, and **Webpack Module Federation** to migrate legacy iframes into a **Micro Frontend architecture**. I also used **React Testing Library and Jest** to ensure high unit test coverage and code quality.

On the **backend**, I helped design and develop **domain-driven microservices** using **Java Spring WebFlux** for reactive, non-blocking APIs. We used **Kafka** for event streaming, and integrated with databases like **Oracle DB** and **Cassandra**.

I contributed to both frontend and backend codebases, implemented accessibility improvements, and ensured our CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins passed quality gates like **Sonar**. The project followed Agile methodology, and I actively participated in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.

Overall, it was a challenging and rewarding project where I had the chance to apply microservices, reactive programming, and advanced state management patterns in a real-world, high-scale environment.
