# Introduction to Criteria API in JPA

The Java Persistence API (JPA) provides multiple ways to query data from a database. While JPQL and Native Queries offer powerful querying capabilities, they are static and may become challenging to maintain for complex, dynamic queries. To address this, JPA offers the **Criteria API**, a dynamic and type-safe way to construct queries programmatically.

In this blog, we will explore the **Criteria API**, its features, and how it can simplify dynamic query generation in JPA-based applications.

## What is the Criteria API?

The **Criteria API** is a part of JPA that allows developers to build queries programmatically. Instead of writing queries as strings (like in JPQL), the Criteria API represents queries as objects, making it easier to construct dynamic queries.

### Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Queries**: Create queries at runtime based on user input or business logic.
2. **Type-Safe**: Leverages JPA metamodel classes to ensure compile-time type safety.
3. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with JPA’s entity management and transaction features.
4. **Composability**: Simplifies the construction of complex queries by chaining method calls.

## Why Use the Criteria API?

1. **Dynamic Query Construction**:
   - JPQL queries are static and need to be concatenated for dynamic conditions, which can lead to errors and inefficiencies.
   - Criteria API allows queries to be built dynamically at runtime without string concatenation.

2. **Type-Safe Queries**:
   - Errors in JPQL queries are only detected at runtime.
   - Criteria API ensures queries are type-safe, catching errors at compile time.

3. **Readable Complex Queries**:
   - Constructing complex queries is more manageable with the Criteria API's programmatic approach.

## Setting Up the Criteria API

### Prerequisites
Ensure your project includes the necessary dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Example Entity: `Employee`

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String department;
    private double salary;

    // Getters and setters

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getDepartment() {
        return department;
    }

    public void setDepartment(String department) {
        this.department = department;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
```

## Basic Usage of the Criteria API

### Step 1: Obtain the `CriteriaBuilder`

The `CriteriaBuilder` is the entry point for building queries using the Criteria API. It is obtained from the `EntityManager`.

```java
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;

@PersistenceContext
private EntityManager entityManager;

CriteriaBuilder criteriaBuilder = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
```

### Step 2: Create a `CriteriaQuery`

The `CriteriaQuery` object represents the query. It defines the result type and query structure.

```java
CriteriaQuery<Employee> criteriaQuery = criteriaBuilder.createQuery(Employee.class);
```

### Step 3: Define the Root Entity

The `Root` represents the main entity being queried.

```java
Root<Employee> root = criteriaQuery.from(Employee.class);
```

### Step 4: Build the Query

Use the `CriteriaBuilder` to define conditions, ordering, and other query features.

#### Example: Select Employees by Department

```java
criteriaQuery.select(root).where(criteriaBuilder.equal(root.get("department"), "IT"));
```

### Step 5: Execute the Query

Use the `EntityManager` to execute the query and retrieve results.

```java
List<Employee> employees = entityManager.createQuery(criteriaQuery).getResultList();
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Retrieve Employees by Department

#### Code:
```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Employee> cq = cb.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> root = cq.from(Employee.class);

cq.select(root).where(cb.equal(root.get("department"), "IT"));

List<Employee> employees = entityManager.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
employees.forEach(System.out::println);
```

#### SQL Execution:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = 'IT';
```

### Example 2: Find Employees with Salary Greater Than

#### Code:
```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Employee> cq = cb.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> root = cq.from(Employee.class);

cq.select(root).where(cb.greaterThan(root.get("salary"), 60000));

List<Employee> highEarners = entityManager.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
highEarners.forEach(System.out::println);
```

#### SQL Execution:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 60000;
```

### Example 3: Department-Wise Employee Count

#### Code:
```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Object[]> cq = cb.createQuery(Object[].class);
Root<Employee> root = cq.from(Employee.class);

cq.multiselect(root.get("department"), cb.count(root))
  .groupBy(root.get("department"));

List<Object[]> results = entityManager.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
for (Object[] result : results) {
    System.out.println("Department: " + result[0] + ", Count: " + result[1]);
}
```

#### SQL Execution:
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employee GROUP BY department;
```

## Advantages of Criteria API

1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time with type-safe queries.
2. **Dynamic Queries**: Easily construct queries at runtime based on user input.
3. **ORM Integration**: Fully integrates with JPA’s entity and transaction management.
4. **Readable Code**: Simplifies the construction of complex queries.

## Limitations of Criteria API

1. **Verbose Syntax**: Requires more lines of code compared to JPQL or Native Queries.
2. **Learning Curve**: May be challenging for developers new to JPA.

## Conclusion

The Criteria API is a powerful feature in JPA for constructing dynamic, type-safe queries. It provides a programmatic alternative to JPQL, making it easier to handle complex query requirements. While it has a steeper learning curve and verbose syntax, its benefits outweigh these drawbacks in scenarios requiring dynamic query generation. Start experimenting with the Criteria API to unlock its full potential in your JPA-based applications!
