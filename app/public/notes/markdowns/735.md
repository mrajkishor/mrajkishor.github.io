## 📊 Introduction to Big Data Analytics

**Big Data Analytics** refers to techniques and tools used to collect, process, and analyze vast and complex datasets to uncover patterns, trends, correlations, and actionable insights. This data is typically characterized by the **Four Vs**:

* **Volume** – Large scale of data
* **Velocity** – High speed of data generation and processing
* **Variety** – Different types (structured, unstructured, semi-structured)
* **Veracity** – Quality and trustworthiness of the data

### 2. **Apache Spark**

* **In-memory processing engine** for faster computation compared to Hadoop MapReduce.
* Supports **batch processing, streaming, ML, and graph processing**.
* Compatible with **Java, Scala, Python**.

### 3. **NoSQL Databases**

* Designed for **flexibility** and **horizontal scaling**, ideal for unstructured data.
* **Types**:

  * **Document-oriented**: MongoDB, CouchDB
  * **Key-Value**: Redis, Riak
  * **Column-family**: Cassandra, HBase
  * **Graph databases**: Neo4j, ArangoDB

### 4. **Apache Kafka**

* A **distributed streaming platform** used for **real-time data ingestion and processing**.
* Handles millions of messages per second; ideal for event-driven architectures.

### 5. **Tableau**

* A powerful **data visualization tool** for exploring and presenting large datasets through interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs.
