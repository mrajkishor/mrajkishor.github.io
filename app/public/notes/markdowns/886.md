## âœ… **Design of Combinational and Sequential Circuits**

Designing digital circuits involves creating logic that fulfills a required function or behavior, either through **combinational** or **sequential** logic. The design approach differs between the two due to memory involvement in sequential circuits.

### ðŸ”· **Design Procedure of a Combinational Circuit**

A **combinational circuit** is one where the output depends **only on the current inputs**, not past inputs (i.e., it has no memory).

#### ðŸ“Œ **Steps to Design a Combinational Circuit**

1. **Problem Identification:**

   * Clearly understand the **goal of the circuit** and the nature of input/output behavior.

2. **Determine Inputs and Outputs:**

   * Count the number of **input variables** (e.g., A, B, C...) and **output variables** (e.g., X, Y...).

3. **Assign Variable Names:**

   * Use **alphabetical symbols** to name inputs and outputs for reference in expressions and diagrams.

4. **Create the Truth Table:**

   * Build a table that lists all **input combinations** and the corresponding **desired outputs**.

5. **Simplify Boolean Expressions:**

   * Use **Karnaugh Maps (K-maps)** or **Boolean algebra** to simplify the logic expressions for each output.

6. **Draw the Logic Diagram:**

   * Convert simplified expressions into a **gate-level logic diagram** using basic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).

### ðŸ”· **Design Procedure of a Sequential Circuit**

A **sequential circuit** is one where the output depends on **both present and past inputs**â€”i.e., it has **memory** through flip-flops or latches.

#### ðŸ“Œ **Steps to Design a Sequential Circuit**

1. **Create a State Diagram:**

   * Define the **states** the system can be in.
   * Use circles to represent states and arrows for **transitions**, labeled with input/output.

2. **Create a State Table / Excitation Table:**

   * Tabulate **present states**, **inputs**, **next states**, and **outputs**.
   * Flip-flop input equations are also included here, depending on the type used (JK, T, D, etc.).

3. **Generate K-Maps for Flip-Flop Inputs:**

   * Use **Karnaugh Maps** to minimize the logic for each flip-flop input (e.g., J, K, T, D).
   * Also minimize output expressions if they depend on state or input.

4. **Draw the Circuit Diagram:**

   * Use the simplified expressions from K-maps to draw the full **gate-level circuit**.
   * Include flip-flops for state memory, input logic, and output logic.

### ðŸ“˜ **Important Components Explained**

* **State Diagram:**
  A **graphical representation** showing how the circuit transitions from one state to another based on input values.

* **State Table:**
  A **tabular version** of the state diagram showing present state, input, next state, and output in organized rows.

* **Excitation Table:**
  Shows what **input conditions** are required for the flip-flops to transition to the desired next state.

* **K-Map:**
  Used to simplify Boolean expressions derived from the excitation table. Outputs and flip-flop input equations are reduced here.

* **Circuit Drawing:**
  Final step, using the **simplified expressions** to connect gates and flip-flops.
