## Time and Space Complexity

---

## 🔍 Introduction

In algorithm analysis, we evaluate how an algorithm performs in terms of:

* **Time Complexity**: How fast it runs
* **Space Complexity**: How much memory it uses

This analysis is independent of programming language or hardware and forms the **core of GATE-level problem-solving**, helping you compare algorithms and select optimal ones under constraints.

## 🕒 Time Complexity

Time complexity expresses the **number of basic operations (typically comparisons or iterations)** the algorithm performs relative to the input size `n`.

### ✅ Notation Types:

| Notation      | Meaning                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Big-O (O)** | Upper bound — worst-case scenario             |
| **Omega (Ω)** | Lower bound — best-case scenario              |
| **Theta (Θ)** | Tight bound — average-case or typical runtime |

> In GATE, **Big-O** is most commonly tested.

| O(n²)      | Bubble Sort, Selection Sort            |
| O(n³)      | Floyd-Warshall All Pairs Shortest Path |

### 📌 Methods to Calculate Time Complexity

1. **Count Dominant Operations** (e.g., loop iterations)
2. **Identify Nested Loops**
3. **Recurrence Relations** (for recursive algorithms)

   * Use the **Master Theorem** (used for Divide & Conquer)

     * `T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)`
4. **Amortized Analysis** (e.g., Dynamic Array append)

### 🔁 Examples

#### 🔹 Example 1: Linear Search

```python
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == key:
        return i
```

* **Time Complexity**: O(n)

---

#### 🔹 Example 2: Nested Loop

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        print(i, j)
```

* **Time Complexity**: O(n²)

---

#### 🔹 Example 3: Recursive Function

```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

* **Time Complexity**: O(2ⁿ)

---

## 💾 Space Complexity

Space complexity is the total **memory required by the algorithm** to complete execution, including:

* Input storage
* Auxiliary variables
* Function call stacks (for recursion)

---

### ✅ Measuring Space Complexity

1. Count **auxiliary variables**
2. Account for **recursive stack depth**
3. Include **temporary data structures** (arrays, hash maps)

### 📊 Common Space Complexities

| Complexity | Example                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| O(1)       | In-place sorting, constant extra space |
| O(n)       | Storing input in an array or hashmap   |
| O(log n)   | Recursive Binary Search (stack space)  |
| O(n²)      | Matrix storage                         |

---

### 🔁 Examples

#### 🔹 Example 1: Iterative Loop

```python
for i in range(n):
    print(i)
```

* **Space Complexity**: O(1) (only loop variable used)

---

#### 🔹 Example 2: Storing a Result Array

```python
result = []
for i in range(n):
    result.append(i)
```

* **Space Complexity**: O(n)

---

#### 🔹 Example 3: Recursive Function with Depth

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
```

* **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to recursion stack

## 🧠 Why It Matters (GATE Perspective)

* Used for **comparison-based decision making**
* Needed in **asymptotic analysis MCQs**
* Required to **select efficient algorithms** under constraints
