## **📌 What is an Agile Core Team (ACT)?**
The **Agile Core Team (ACT)** is a **feature development team** that focuses on **delivering business value through Agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, or SAFe**.

Unlike the **Platform Core Team (PCT)**, which builds reusable infrastructure and internal tools, **ACT focuses on delivering customer-facing features and enhancements**.

### **🔹 Example: Role of ACT in a Product-Based Company**
Consider an **e-commerce company** like Amazon:
- The **Product Team** wants to introduce a **"Buy Now" button** for faster checkout.
- The **Agile Core Team (ACT)** is responsible for designing, developing, testing, and deploying this feature.
- ACT members **collaborate with product managers, UI/UX designers, and QA engineers** to ensure the feature meets business and technical requirements.

### **🔹 Key Characteristics of ACT**
✅ **Self-organizing** – Team members take ownership of product features.  
✅ **Cross-functional** – Includes developers, testers, designers, and DevOps engineers.  
✅ **Iterative & Incremental** – Delivers features in **small, testable increments**.  
✅ **Customer-centric** – Works closely with stakeholders to **deliver user value quickly**.  
✅ **Adaptive & Collaborative** – Responds to **changing requirements** effectively.  

---

## **📌 Key Responsibilities of an Agile Core Team**
ACT members work together in Agile iterations (Sprints) to **develop, test, and deploy new features efficiently**.

### **1️⃣ Feature Development**
✅ Writing **scalable, maintainable, and efficient code**.  
✅ Implementing **REST APIs, front-end UIs, and database operations**.  
✅ Ensuring **compatibility with existing system architecture**.  
✅ Integrating with **third-party services, APIs, and databases**.  

### **2️⃣ Agile Planning & Execution**
✅ Participating in **Sprint Planning**, defining user stories & acceptance criteria.  
✅ **Breaking down Epics into small deliverables** (Backlog Refinement).  
✅ Conducting **Daily Standups (Scrum Meetings)** to track progress.  
✅ Delivering **Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) quickly**.  

### **3️⃣ Testing & Quality Assurance**
✅ Writing **unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests**.  
✅ Performing **automated and manual testing** for bug-free releases.  
✅ Working with QA engineers to ensure **high test coverage**.  
✅ Incorporating **Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**.  

### **4️⃣ Collaboration & Communication**
✅ Working closely with **Product Managers, UI/UX Designers, and DevOps Engineers**.  
✅ Conducting **Sprint Reviews & Retrospectives** to improve processes.  
✅ Coordinating with **business stakeholders** for feature prioritization.  
✅ Resolving dependencies with other teams (e.g., Platform Core Team, Security Team).  

### **5️⃣ Deployment & DevOps Integration**
✅ Using **CI/CD pipelines** to automate deployment.  
✅ Ensuring **zero-downtime releases** through canary/blue-green deployments.  
✅ Monitoring feature performance using **observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus, ELK stack)**.  
✅ Rolling back unsuccessful deployments **without disrupting users**.

## **📌 How ACT Differs from Platform Core Team (PCT)?**
| **Aspect** | **Agile Core Team (ACT)** | **Platform Core Team (PCT)** |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Focus** | Business feature development | Infrastructure, internal tools, DevOps |
| **Ownership** | End-to-end delivery of features | Platform, scalability, and tooling |
| **Users** | Customers, Product Owners, Business Teams | Developers, SREs, DevOps Teams |
| **Collaboration** | Works with stakeholders, UI/UX, QA | Works with ACTs, security, cloud teams |
| **Examples** | "Buy Now" button in an e-commerce app | CI/CD pipelines, API Gateway, Authentication Service |

Both **PCT and ACT work together** in large organizations to **deliver high-quality, scalable software**.

---

## **📌 How ACT Works in a Product-Based Company**
ACT follows **Agile and DevOps** best practices to deliver **customer-focused features rapidly**.

### **🔹 Step 1: Sprint Planning & Backlog Grooming**
- Product Owner defines **user stories** and prioritizes them in the backlog.
- Agile Core Team estimates stories using **story points (Fibonacci, T-Shirt Sizing, etc.).**
- Developers, testers, and designers discuss **technical feasibility and design**.

### **🔹 Step 2: Development Phase**
- Developers write **clean, maintainable code**.
- Pair programming and **code reviews** ensure high quality.
- Automated **unit and integration tests** are written for every feature.

### **🔹 Step 3: Testing & QA**
- Testers perform **functional, regression, and performance testing**.
- **Automated test suites** run on CI/CD pipelines.
- Bugs are tracked and fixed before merging.

### **🔹 Step 4: Deployment & Monitoring**
- Code is **deployed using CI/CD pipelines**.
- Monitoring tools track **performance, errors, and user behavior**.
- Logs and analytics help identify **areas for improvement**.

### **🔹 Step 5: Sprint Review & Retrospective**
- Stakeholders review completed work.
- The team reflects on what went well and what needs improvement.

## **📌 Key Agile Practices Used in ACT**
To **deliver high-quality software efficiently**, ACT adopts various **Agile practices**:

✅ **Scrum Framework** – Short, iterative development cycles (Sprints).  
✅ **Kanban** – Continuous delivery with flexible work prioritization.  
✅ **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** – Writing tests before code.  
✅ **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** – Writing tests in **human-readable format** (Cucumber, Gherkin).  
✅ **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)** – Automated pipelines for faster releases.  
✅ **DevOps & Shift-Left Testing** – Integrating security and testing early in the SDLC.  
✅ **Trunk-Based Development** – Avoiding long-lived feature branches to speed up integration.

## **📌 Challenges Faced by ACT**
🚧 **Handling Rapid Requirement Changes** → Agile embraces change, but frequent scope changes slow down progress.  
🚧 **Maintaining Cross-Team Collaboration** → ACTs must align with Platform Teams, Security Teams, and other feature teams.  
🚧 **Ensuring Code Quality & Technical Debt Management** → Fast feature development often leads to **accumulated tech debt**.  
🚧 **Balancing Speed vs. Stability** → Features must be released **quickly without compromising stability**.  

✅ **Solution:**  
- Implement **Feature Flags** to deploy incomplete features safely.  
- Conduct **Frequent Refactoring** to keep codebase clean.  
- Use **Agile Metrics (Lead Time, Cycle Time, Velocity)** to track efficiency.
