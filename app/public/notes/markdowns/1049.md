###  **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**

---

## üîç **What is BFS?**

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is a graph traversal technique used to explore nodes level-by-level starting from a **source node**. It uses a **queue data structure** and is especially useful for finding the **shortest path in unweighted graphs**.

In an unweighted graph, the shortest path is measured in terms of the **minimum number of edges** from the source to the destination. BFS guarantees this minimum because it visits all vertices at distance `d` before visiting vertices at distance `d+1`.

## ‚úÖ **When to Use BFS for Shortest Path**

| Scenario                        | BFS is Valid? | Why?                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Unweighted Undirected Graph** | ‚úÖ Yes         | Equal weight = 1 for all edges            |
| **Unweighted Directed Graph**   | ‚úÖ Yes         | BFS still applies level-wise              |
| **Weighted Graph**              | ‚ùå No          | BFS ignores edge weights; Dijkstra needed |

## üß† **Core Logic**

* BFS starts from the source node and explores its immediate neighbors.
* Then it explores neighbors of neighbors, and so on.
* The first time a node is visited, it is guaranteed to be via the shortest path (minimum number of edges).

---

## üßÆ **Algorithm**

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_shortest_path(adj, source):
    n = len(adj)
    visited = [False] * n
    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    queue = deque()

    visited[source] = True
    dist[source] = 0
    queue.append(source)

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)

    return dist
```

### Key Points:

* `adj`: adjacency list
* `dist[i]`: stores shortest distance from `source` to node `i`

---

## üß™ **Example**

**Graph:**

```
0 --- 1 --- 2
|     |
3     4
```

**Adjacency List:**

```python
adj = {
    0: [1, 3],
    1: [0, 2, 4],
    2: [1],
    3: [0],
    4: [1]
}
```

**Output from `bfs_shortest_path(adj, 0)`**:

```python
dist = [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]
```

* `0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2` ‚Üí 2 edges
* `0 ‚Üí 3` ‚Üí 1 edge
* `0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 4` ‚Üí 2 edges

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity**

| Measure              | Value                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Time Complexity**  | `O(V + E)`                                |
| **Space Complexity** | `O(V)` (for `visited`, `dist`, and queue) |

Where:

* `V` = number of vertices
* `E` = number of edges

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes**

* Not marking nodes as **visited immediately** (can lead to infinite loop)
* Assuming it works on **weighted graphs** (it doesn't)
* Confusing **BFS traversal order** with **shortest path**

## üìå **BFS vs DFS for Shortest Path**

| Feature              | BFS                        | DFS                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Path optimality      | ‚úÖ Always gives shortest    | ‚ùå Not guaranteed        |
| Works on unweighted? | ‚úÖ Yes                      | ‚úÖ Yes (only for trees)  |
| Cycles handling      | ‚úÖ Yes (with visited array) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Must handle manually |
| Traversal order      | Level-wise                 | Depth-wise              |

## üß† **GATE Exam Tips**

* Be ready to implement **BFS from scratch**
* You may be asked to **trace the algorithm** on a small graph
* Know when **BFS is not suitable** (i.e., when edge weights exist)
* Be prepared for **modifications** like tracking the actual path or applying to grids

## üß© **BFS Variants for Competitive/GATE Use**

| Variant                 | Description                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-source BFS**    | Start BFS from multiple nodes               |
| **0-1 BFS**             | For graphs with weights 0 or 1 using deque  |
| **Grid BFS**            | BFS on 2D matrices (maze problems)          |
| **Path Reconstruction** | Use parent array to reconstruct actual path |

---

## üéØ **Summary**

* BFS is the **standard approach** to compute shortest paths in **unweighted graphs**
* It guarantees **minimal number of edges** from source to each node
* Uses **queue**, **visited set**, and **distance array**
* **Time complexity: O(V + E)** ‚Äî very efficient for sparse graphs
* A must-know for **GATE** and coding interviews
