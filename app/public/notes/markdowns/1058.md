### 1. üó∫Ô∏è **GPS & Navigation Systems**

* **Use Case**: Finding the fastest route from one location to another.
* **Example**: Google Maps, Uber, Ola.
* **Algorithm Used**:

  * **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** for accurate route with known weights (e.g., distance or time).
  * **A* Algorithm*\* for faster performance using heuristics (e.g., straight-line distance).
* **Graph Representation**: Road network as a weighted graph (intersections = nodes, roads = edges, travel time = weight).

### 2. üåê **Network Routing (Internet/Data Packets)**

* **Use Case**: Finding the most efficient path for data packets through routers.
* **Example**: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), BGP.
* **Algorithm Used**:

  * **Bellman-Ford** in distance-vector routing protocols.

### 3. ‚úàÔ∏è **Airline Route Planning**

* **Use Case**: Finding the shortest or cheapest path between two airports.
* **Example**: Skyscanner, airline internal planning.
* **Algorithm Used**:

  * **Dijkstra** or **Floyd-Warshall** for cost/time minimization.
  * **Johnson‚Äôs Algorithm** for all-pairs shortest path in large networks.
