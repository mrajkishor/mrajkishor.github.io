### Introduction
Simple linear regression is one of the most fundamental concepts in machine learning and statistics. It provides a straightforward way to model the relationship between two variables—one independent (predictor) variable and one dependent (response) variable—using a straight line. This technique is often the first step in understanding how variables relate to one another and is widely used in data analysis and predictive modeling.

This blog will take you through the key concepts, mathematical foundation, implementation, and practical applications of simple linear regression.

### What is Simple Linear Regression?
Simple linear regression is a method to predict the value of one variable (dependent variable, \( y \)) based on the value of another variable (independent variable, \( x \)). The relationship is modeled using a straight line:

\[
y = mx + c
\]

Where:
- \( y \): Dependent variable (response/output)
- \( x \): Independent variable (predictor/input)
- \( m \): Slope of the line
- \( c \): Intercept (the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \))

The goal of simple linear regression is to determine the values of \( m \) and \( c \) that best fit the data.

---

### Key Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression
For simple linear regression to work effectively, the following assumptions must hold true:
1. **Linearity**: The relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) is linear.
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residuals (errors) is constant across all levels of \( x \).
4. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed.

---

### Mathematical Foundation

#### 1. **Equation of the Line**
The linear equation for predicting \( y \) is:
\[
\hat{y} = mx + c
\]
Where:
- \( \hat{y} \): Predicted value of \( y \)
- \( m \): Slope of the regression line, calculated as:
  \[
  m = \frac{\text{Cov}(x, y)}{\text{Var}(x)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
  \]
- \( c \): Intercept, calculated as:
  \[
  c = \bar{y} - m\bar{x}
  \]
- \( \bar{x} \) and \( \bar{y} \): Mean of \( x \) and \( y \), respectively.

#### 2. **Cost Function**
To find the best-fit line, simple linear regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals (errors). The cost function is:
\[
\text{Cost} = \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
\]
Where \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value and \( y_i \) is the actual value.

### Steps in Simple Linear Regression

#### 1. **Data Collection**
Collect data that includes one dependent variable (\( y \)) and one independent variable (\( x \)).

#### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize the data using a scatter plot to check if a linear relationship exists.
- Compute summary statistics (mean, variance, covariance).

#### 3. **Model Fitting**
- Calculate the slope (\( m \)) and intercept (\( c \)) using the formulas mentioned above.
- Fit the regression line to the data.

#### 4. **Prediction**
Use the regression equation to predict the dependent variable (\( y \)) for new values of the independent variable (\( x \)).

#### 5. **Evaluation**
Evaluate the model using metrics like:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
  \]
- **R-squared (\( R^2 \))**:
  \[
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SS}_{\text{residual}}}{\text{SS}_{\text{total}}}
  \]
  \( R^2 \) measures the proportion of variance in \( y \) explained by \( x \).

### Example: Simple Linear Regression in Python

#### Dataset
We'll use a synthetic dataset where the independent variable (\( x \)) is the number of hours studied, and the dependent variable (\( y \)) is the score achieved.

#### Implementation
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Data: Hours studied vs Scores
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Independent variable
y = np.array([15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 50, 55, 65, 70])      # Dependent variable

# Create and fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x, y)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(x)

# Model coefficients
m = model.coef_[0]
c = model.intercept_

# Evaluation metrics
mse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y, y_pred)

print(f"Slope (m): {m}")
print(f"Intercept (c): {c}")
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")

# Visualization
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue', label='Actual data')
plt.plot(x, y_pred, color='red', label='Regression line')
plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Simple Linear Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

#### Output
- **Slope (m)**: 7.05
- **Intercept (c)**: -0.5
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 10.27
- **R-squared**: 0.98

The regression line closely fits the data, indicating a strong linear relationship between hours studied and scores achieved.

   - Slope (\( m \)):
     \[
     m = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
     \]

     | 2         | 4         | -3                | -3.4              | 10.2                             | 9                     |
     | 3         | 5         | -2                | -2.4              | 4.8                              | 4                     |
     | 5         | 7         | 0                 | -0.4              | 0                                | 0                     |
     | 7         | 10        | 2                 | 2.6               | 5.2                              | 4                     |
     | 8         | 11        | 3                 | 3.6               | 10.8                             | 9                     |

     - Sum:
       \[
       \sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) = 10.2 + 4.8 + 0 + 5.2 + 10.8 = 31
       \]
       \[
       \sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 9 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 9 = 26
       \]

   - Compute \( m \):
     \[
     m = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \frac{31}{26} = 1.192
     \]

   - Compute \( c \):
     \[
     c = \bar{y} - m\bar{x} = 7.4 - 1.192 \cdot 5 = 7.4 - 5.96 = 1.44
     \]

3. **Prediction**:
   - The regression equation is:
     \[
     y = 1.192x + 1.44
     \]
   - Predict \( y \) for \( x = 6 \):
     \[
     y = 1.192 \cdot 6 + 1.44 = 7.152 + 1.44 = 8.592
     \]

#### Final Answers:
1. Slope (\( m \)): **1.192**
2. Intercept (\( c \)): **1.44**
3. Predicted \( y \) for \( x = 6 \): **8.592 (approximately 8.6)**

   \]
   For each \( x \):
   - \( x = 10 \): \( \hat{y} = 2 \cdot 10 + 60 = 80 \)
   - \( x = 15 \): \( \hat{y} = 2 \cdot 15 + 60 = 90 \)
   - \( x = 20 \): \( \hat{y} = 2 \cdot 20 + 60 = 100 \)

     | 100       | 90             | 100                       |
     | 120       | 100            | 400                       |
     | 140       | 110            | 900                       |

   - Sum of squared errors:
     \[
     \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 = 0 + 100 + 400 + 900 = 1400
     \]

   - MSE:
     \[
     \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 = \frac{1400}{4} = 350
     \]
