### 1.1 Language Processors

* **Programming languages** are the medium for expressing computations. They need translation before execution.
* **Translators**:

  * **Compiler** ‚Äì Translates source ‚Üí target machine code.
  * **Interpreter** ‚Äì Directly executes source program line by line.
  * **Preprocessors** ‚Äì Perform tasks like macro expansion.
* Compilers provide portability (same source ‚Üí different target machines). Interpreters give flexibility but are slower.

### 1.2 Structure of a Compiler

A compiler works in **phases**, often grouped into front-end and back-end:

1. **Lexical Analysis** ‚Äì Converts character stream ‚Üí tokens using finite automata.
2. **Syntax Analysis (Parsing)** ‚Äì Builds parse trees using context-free grammars.
3. **Semantic Analysis** ‚Äì Type checking, consistency verification.
4. **Intermediate Code Generation** ‚Äì Produces an abstract machine-independent form (e.g., TAC).
5. **Code Optimization** ‚Äì Improves efficiency (loop optimizations, strength reduction, etc.).
6. **Code Generation** ‚Äì Translates IR ‚Üí assembly/machine code.
7. **Symbol Table Management** ‚Äì Tracks identifiers and attributes.
8. **Error Handling** ‚Äì Lexical, syntactic, and semantic error recovery.
9. **Passes** ‚Äì A compiler may be one-pass or multi-pass depending on how phases are grouped.

### 1.3 Evolution of Programming Languages

* **Move to higher-level languages** reduced programmer effort but increased compiler complexity.
* Each new language feature (objects, closures, polymorphism) requires new compiler strategies.
* **Impact on compilers**: more complex front-ends, need for optimization, and handling diverse architectures.

### 1.4 The Science of Building a Compiler

* Compiler design is a balance between **theory** (mathematical models) and **practice** (efficient implementation).
* **Key models**:

  * **Finite automata + Regular expressions** ‚Üí for tokens.
  * **Context-free grammars** ‚Üí for syntax.
  * **Trees and DAGs** ‚Üí for intermediate forms.
* **Optimization science**:

  * ‚ÄúOptimization‚Äù ‚â† guaranteed best code.
  * Aim: produce *better* code within reasonable time and correctness constraints.
* **Challenges**: correctness, performance improvement, compilation time, and engineering effort.

### 1.5 Applications of Compiler Technology

Beyond compiling, compiler techniques apply to:

1. **Implementation of high-level languages** (C, Java, etc.).
2. **Architectural optimizations** (taking advantage of pipelining, multicore, etc.).
3. **Design of new architectures** (compiler input shapes ISA decisions).
4. **Program translations** (cross-compilers, decompilers, binary translators).
5. **Software productivity tools** (IDEs, static analyzers, security scanners).

### 1.6 Programming Language Basics

Foundational concepts for compiler design:

* **Static vs Dynamic**: properties known at compile time (types, scope) vs runtime (dynamic binding).
* **Environments & States**: mapping between variable names, memory locations, and values.
* **Scope**:

  * **Static scope** ‚Üí determined by program structure.
  * **Dynamic scope** ‚Üí determined by call chain.
* **Block structure** ‚Üí nested scopes with symbol tables.
* **Parameter passing**: call-by-value, call-by-reference, call-by-name.
* **Aliasing**: multiple names for the same memory location, complicating optimization.

### 1.7 Summary

* A compiler is not just a translator; it embodies theory, algorithms, and system-level engineering.
* Knowledge of compilers extends to optimizations, program analysis, architecture design, and even advanced tools like interpreters and JITs.

# ‚úÖ GATE Pointers

* **Lexical vs Syntax analysis** ‚Üí DFA vs CFG distinction is a classic GATE question.
* **Passes**: one-pass vs multi-pass compilers frequently asked.
* **Parameter passing & scope rules** ‚Üí appear repeatedly in PYQs.
* **Applications of compilers** ‚Üí trick questions may ask about interpreters vs compilers.
* **Optimization**: ‚ÄúWhy optimization is a misnomer?‚Äù is a conceptual favorite.
