### 📌 **Introduction to Wireless Encryption Protocol (WEP)**

**WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)** is a security protocol designed to provide **confidentiality for wireless networks** equivalent to that of wired networks. It was introduced in **1997** as part of the **IEEE 802.11** Wi-Fi standard to secure data transmitted over the air.

## 🔐 **How WEP Works**

WEP uses **symmetric key cryptography**, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The two main components of WEP’s operation are:

### 🔸 **1. RC4 Stream Cipher**

* WEP uses the **RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)** stream cipher for data encryption.
* RC4 generates a **pseudorandom keystream**, which is **XORed with plaintext** to produce ciphertext.
* The same operation in reverse (XOR with the same keystream) decrypts the message.

### 🔸 **2. Shared Key Authentication**

* WEP uses a **pre-shared key (PSK)** for authentication.
* The **client and the access point (AP)** must have the same key configured in advance.
* The key is used to encrypt/decrypt data packets and authenticate the devices.

## ⚠️ **Limitations of WEP**

Although WEP was a milestone in early wireless security, it has significant weaknesses that make it insecure by today’s standards:

### 🔸 **1. Weak Encryption**

* RC4 implementation in WEP is flawed; attackers can **capture enough packets to recover the encryption key** using tools like Aircrack-ng.

### 🔸 **2. Short Keys**

* WEP supports:

  * **40-bit keys (WEP-64)** – very weak.
  * **104-bit keys (WEP-128)** – still insufficient by modern standards.
* These key sizes can be **brute-forced** in a short time.

### 🔸 **3. Poor Key Management**

* WEP uses a **single static key** for all devices in the network.
* Frequent key rotation is **not practical**, leading to long-term use of vulnerable keys.

### 🔸 **4. Initialization Vector (IV) Reuse**

* WEP uses a 24-bit IV (Initialization Vector), which is **too short and often reused**, making the encryption more predictable and easier to break.

## 🔄 **Replacement and Successors**

Due to WEP’s critical flaws, it has been **officially deprecated** and replaced by more secure protocols:

### 🔹 **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**

* Introduced as a **temporary fix** for WEP’s vulnerabilities.
* Uses **Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)** for better encryption and key management.

### 🔹 **WPA2**

* The most widely adopted standard.
* Uses **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** and **CCMP** encryption for high security.
* Mandatory for Wi-Fi certification from 2006 onwards.

### 🔹 **WPA3**

* Latest generation offering:

  * **Stronger encryption**
  * **Individualized data encryption**
  * Protection against **dictionary attacks**
  * Suitable for both **home and enterprise** environments

## ✅ **Conclusion**

**WEP** was an important early step toward wireless security, but due to its **cryptographic flaws and weak key management**, it is now considered **insecure** and obsolete. Modern wireless networks should use **WPA2 or WPA3**, which offer **robust encryption and better protection** against modern cyber threats.
