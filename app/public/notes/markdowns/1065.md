##  **ACID Properties**

---

### ✅ What are ACID Properties?

ACID is a foundational concept in **relational database systems** that ensures **data reliability**, especially in the presence of concurrent transactions, system crashes, or hardware failures.

**ACID** stands for:

1. **Atomicity**
2. **Consistency**
3. **Isolation**
4. **Durability**

PostgreSQL, as a robust transactional RDBMS, **fully supports ACID** via its internal mechanisms like **MVCC**, **WAL**, **transaction logs**, and **concurrent control systems**.

---

## 🔹 1. Atomicity → *"All or Nothing"*

### 📌 Definition:

A transaction must either **complete fully** or **have no effect at all**. Partial changes should never be visible.

### 🧠 PostgreSQL Mechanism:

* Maintains **transactional visibility** using `xmin`, `xmax` tuple metadata.
* Uses a **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)** to log changes before applying them.
* **Rollback** is automatic if a transaction fails (e.g., due to constraint violation).

### ✅ Example:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

If the second update fails, **none** of the changes are committed.

### 💡 Insight:

Atomicity in PostgreSQL enables complex **multi-step workflows**, like **distributed payments or interdependent updates**, to be modeled safely using **savepoints**, retries, and `ROLLBACK`.

---

## 🔹 2. Consistency → *"Valid State → Valid State"*

### 📌 Definition:

A transaction must transition the database from one **logically consistent state to another**, preserving all **constraints, rules, and relationships**.

### 🧠 PostgreSQL Enforces Consistency Through:

* **Constraint Enforcement**: `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `NOT NULL`
* **User-defined Rules** and **Triggers**
* **Data Type Enforcement**: No silent coercion or rounding
* **Deferrable Constraints**: Check at commit time (e.g., for batch updates)

### ✅ Example:

```sql
-- Throws error if foreign key doesn't match
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id) VALUES (99999);
```

### 💡  Insight:

PostgreSQL's strong typing and constraint system makes it ideal for **data integrity-sensitive domains**, like **banking, logistics**, or **medical systems** where **violating referential rules could be fatal**.

---

## 🔹 3. Isolation → *"Transactions Don't Interfere"*

### 📌 Definition:

Concurrent transactions should behave **as if they were executed serially**, even though they’re processed in parallel.

### 🧠 PostgreSQL’s Implementation:

* Uses **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)**:

  * Readers never block writers.
  * Writers don’t block readers.
* Each transaction sees a **snapshot** of the data as of its start.
* Supports **4 SQL Isolation Levels**:

  | Level            | Supported | Details                                                                |
  | ---------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Read Uncommitted | ❌         | Not supported; PostgreSQL promotes to Read Committed                   |
  | Read Committed   | ✅         | Sees only data committed before each statement                         |
  | Repeatable Read  | ✅         | Snapshot at transaction start; phantom reads possible                  |
  | Serializable     | ✅         | Emulates full serial execution via predicate locking & conflict checks |

### ✅ Example:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
-- Safe from race conditions like double spend
```

### 💡  Insight:

PostgreSQL’s serializable isolation is powerful enough for **bank-grade consistency**. It internally builds a **conflict graph**, and aborts transactions if **cycles** (i.e., possible anomalies) are detected — eliminating phantom reads without locks.

---

## 🔹 4. Durability → *"Once Committed, Always Persisted"*

### 📌 Definition:

Once a transaction is committed, its data **must survive crashes, power failures, and OS-level interruptions**.

### 🧠 PostgreSQL Guarantees Durability Through:

* **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)**:

  * Logs every change before writing to disk
  * Stored in `pg_wal/`
* **fsync() or O\_DIRECT** to persist to disk
* **Checkpoints**:

  * Periodically flush dirty pages from memory to disk
* **Crash Recovery**:

  * On restart, WAL is replayed from the last checkpoint

### ✅ Example:

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO logs VALUES ('critical data');
COMMIT;
```

Even if PostgreSQL crashes after `COMMIT`, data will be **recovered from WAL**.

### 💡  Insight:

PostgreSQL supports **asynchronous replication**, but for strict durability in critical systems (like payment ledgers), use:

* `synchronous_commit = on`
* `wal_level = replica`
* `archive_mode = on`
* **replica sync confirmation** on commit.

## 🧪 PostgreSQL Internals That Power ACID

| Property    | PostgreSQL Feature(s)                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Atomicity   | WAL, MVCC, Savepoints, Rollback               |
| Consistency | Constraints, Data Types, Triggers             |
| Isolation   | MVCC, Serializable Isolation, Transaction IDs |
| Durability  | WAL, fsync, Checkpoints, Crash Recovery       |

## 📌 ACID in Distributed Systems

While PostgreSQL is single-node ACID-compliant, Enterprise-scale systems often need **distributed consistency**, where:

* **Sharding + ACID** → Use **Citus**, **CockroachDB**, or **application-layer 2PC**.
* **Logical Replication + Ordering Guarantees** → Enforce **exactly-once delivery semantics** via WAL LSNs.
* **ACID + Eventual Consistency** → Mix PostgreSQL with Kafka, CDC, and idempotent consumers.

| ACID Property   | PostgreSQL Implementation            | Common Use Cases                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Atomicity**   | WAL, MVCC, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`   | Multi-table updates, banking transfers    |
| **Consistency** | FK/PK/UNIQUE/CHECK, triggers         | Enforce rules like referential integrity  |
| **Isolation**   | MVCC, isolation levels, snapshotting | Concurrent transactions, race protection  |
| **Durability**  | WAL, checkpoints, crash recovery     | System failure recovery, reliable commits |

## 🧠 Pro Tip for Interviews

> **Q: How does PostgreSQL achieve ACID without locking reads?**
> **A:** PostgreSQL uses **MVCC**, where each transaction sees a consistent snapshot. Writers create new row versions rather than blocking readers. WAL ensures changes are durable before being visible.
