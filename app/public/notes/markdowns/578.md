# 🌟 A★ (A Star) Algorithm – The Smartest Shortest Path Solver

_YT : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lusRf5v-TI0_

The **A★ algorithm** is one of the most powerful and efficient algorithms for solving **shortest path problems**, especially when navigating from a **start** node to a specific **goal**. It's widely used in **game development**, **robotics**, **maps**, and **AI pathfinding**.

It combines the best of:

* 🧭 **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (guaranteed shortest path)
* 🚀 **Greedy Best-First Search** (fast toward the goal)

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

A★ uses both:

* **g(n)** → cost to reach the current node from the start
* **h(n)** → heuristic estimate to reach the goal from current node

And selects nodes to explore based on:

```text
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
```

Where:

* `f(n)` is the **total estimated cost** of the cheapest path through `n`
* `h(n)` is the **heuristic function**

👉 Nodes with the **lowest `f(n)`** are explored first.

## 📦 When to Use A★

| Situation                         | Use A★? |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| Pathfinding on maps or grids      | ✅ Yes   |
| Need shortest path to a goal node | ✅ Yes   |
| Graph has positive weights        | ✅ Yes   |
| Graph has negative weights        | ❌ No    |
| Want a fast, smart search         | ✅ Yes   |

## ⚙️ Heuristic Function `h(n)`

A good heuristic is:

* **Admissible** → Never overestimates the cost
* **Consistent** → Follows triangle inequality: `h(u) ≤ cost(u, v) + h(v)`

### Examples:

| Domain          | h(n) =                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Grid (4-way)    | Manhattan distance `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)` |
| Grid (8-way)    | Chebyshev distance `max(dx, dy)`                 |
| Euclidean space | Euclidean distance `sqrt((x1-x2)² + (y1-y2)²)`   |

---

## 🧱 Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize:

   * `openSet` (priority queue with start node)
   * `g[n] = ∞` for all nodes; `g[start] = 0`
   * `f[n] = ∞` for all nodes; `f[start] = h(start)`
2. While `openSet` is not empty:

   * Pop node `n` with lowest `f(n)`
   * If `n` is the goal → return path
   * For each neighbor `m`:

     * `tentative_g = g[n] + cost(n, m)`
     * If `tentative_g < g[m]`, update:

       * `g[m] = tentative_g`
       * `f[m] = g[m] + h(m)`
       * Add `m` to openSet
3. If goal is never reached → return failure

## 💻 Java Implementation (Grid Example)

```java
import java.util.*;

class AStar {
    static class Node implements Comparable<Node> {
        int x, y, g, h;
        Node parent;
        Node(int x, int y, int g, int h, Node parent) {
            this.x = x; this.y = y;
            this.g = g; this.h = h;
            this.parent = parent;
        }

        int f() { return g + h; }

        public int compareTo(Node other) {
            return this.f() - other.f();
        }
    }

    static int[][] dirs = {{0,1},{1,0},{-1,0},{0,-1}}; // 4 directions

    static int heuristic(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        return Math.abs(x1 - x2) + Math.abs(y1 - y2); // Manhattan
    }

    public static List<int[]> aStar(int[][] grid, int[] start, int[] goal) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
        PriorityQueue<Node> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        pq.offer(new Node(start[0], start[1], 0, heuristic(start[0], start[1], goal[0], goal[1]), null));

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Node curr = pq.poll();
            if (curr.x == goal[0] && curr.y == goal[1]) {
                List<int[]> path = new ArrayList<>();
                while (curr != null) {
                    path.add(new int[]{curr.x, curr.y});
                    curr = curr.parent;
                }
                Collections.reverse(path);
                return path;
            }

            visited[curr.x][curr.y] = true;

            for (int[] d : dirs) {
                int nx = curr.x + d[0], ny = curr.y + d[1];
                if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < m && ny < n && grid[nx][ny] == 0 && !visited[nx][ny]) {
                    int g = curr.g + 1;
                    int h = heuristic(nx, ny, goal[0], goal[1]);
                    pq.offer(new Node(nx, ny, g, h, curr));
                }
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(); // no path
    }
}
```

## ✅ Final Notes

* A★ is **fast, optimal, and goal-directed** when paired with a **good heuristic**.
* It's a practical upgrade to Dijkstra for **targeted pathfinding**.
* Always ensure the heuristic is **admissible** to maintain correctness.
