## 📘 Graph Algorithms – Basics

### 🔹 Topic: **Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS)**

---

## 🔹 1. What is Graph Traversal?

Graph traversal means **visiting each vertex** in a graph **in a systematic way**, typically starting from a source vertex.

Two standard traversal algorithms covered in **GATE DA** are:

* **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
* **DFS (Depth-First Search)**

---

## 🔹 2. BFS – Breadth-First Search

### ✅ Definition:

* BFS explores a graph **level by level**
* It uses a **queue (FIFO)** data structure
* Visits all neighbors of the current vertex before going deeper

### 📉 Steps:

1. Start at the source node and enqueue it
2. Mark it as visited
3. While queue is not empty:

   * Dequeue node `u`
   * Enqueue all **unvisited** neighbors of `u` and mark them visited

### ✅ Use-case Examples:

* Shortest path in unweighted graphs
* Web crawling
* Peer-to-peer networks
* Social networking suggestions

### 📌 Time & Space Complexity:

* **Time:** O(V + E)
* **Space:** O(V) (for visited array + queue)

### 🧠 GATE Tip:

* BFS on an unweighted graph gives the **minimum number of edges** from source to all other vertices

---

## 🔹 3. DFS – Depth-First Search

### ✅ Definition:

* DFS explores a graph **as far as possible** along each branch before backtracking
* Uses a **stack (LIFO)** or recursion (function call stack)

### 📉 Steps:

1. Start at source node `s`, mark it visited
2. Recursively or iteratively visit **unvisited** neighbors
3. Backtrack when no unvisited neighbors remain

### ✅ Use-case Examples:

* Topological sorting
* Cycle detection
* Connected components
* Maze solving

### 📌 Time & Space Complexity:

* **Time:** O(V + E)
* **Space:** O(V) (for visited + recursion stack)

### 🧠 GATE Tip:

* DFS is ideal for **reachability**, **connected component** identification, and **graph coloring**

## 🔹 4. Traversal Example

Let’s consider an undirected graph:

```
     0
    / \
   1   2
        \
         3
```

### BFS (from node 0):

* Order: `0 → 1 → 2 → 3`

### DFS (from node 0):

* Order (one possibility): `0 → 1 → 2 → 3`

Note: DFS order may vary based on adjacency list order.

## 🔹 5. Python Code Templates

### ✅ BFS (Using Queue):

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node, end=" ")
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend([n for n in graph[node] if n not in visited])
```

### ✅ DFS (Recursive):

```python
def dfs(graph, node, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    print(node, end=" ")
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
```
