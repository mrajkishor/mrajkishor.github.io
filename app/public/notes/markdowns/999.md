## **Schedules and Conflict Serializability**

---

### 📘 What is a Schedule?

A **schedule** is a **sequence of interleaved operations** (reads/writes/commits) from **two or more concurrent transactions**, preserving the **order of operations within each transaction**.

> In databases, schedules model real-world interleaving of transactions for concurrency and performance.

### 📌 Types of Schedules

| Type                          | Description                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Serial Schedule**           | Transactions run one after the other, no interleaving            |
| **Concurrent Schedule**       | Operations from multiple transactions are interleaved            |
| **Serializable Schedule**     | Concurrent schedule that is equivalent to some serial schedule   |
| **Non-Serializable Schedule** | Produces results that don’t match any serial execution — unsafe! |

### 🔎 Need for Conflict Serializability

Concurrency is important for performance, but it can lead to:

* **Lost updates**
* **Dirty reads**
* **Unrepeatable reads**

**Conflict serializability** ensures correctness **without requiring purely serial execution**.

## 🔄 Conflict Serializability

A schedule is **conflict-serializable** if it can be **transformed into a serial schedule by swapping non-conflicting operations**.

---

### 🔺 When Do Two Operations Conflict?

Operations conflict if they:

1. Belong to **different transactions**
2. Operate on the **same data item**
3. At least one is a **write**

| Operation Pair | Conflict? |
| -------------- | --------- |
| R1(X), R2(X)   | ❌ No      |
| R1(X), W2(X)   | ✅ Yes     |
| W1(X), R2(X)   | ✅ Yes     |
| W1(X), W2(X)   | ✅ Yes     |

## 🧮 Checking Conflict Serializability with **Precedence Graph**

Also called a **serialization graph**.

### 👣 Steps:

1. **Nodes** = Transactions
2. For every pair of **conflicting operations**, draw a directed edge:

   * If **Ti** performs the first conflicting operation on **X**
   * And **Tj** performs the second conflicting operation on **X**
   * Draw edge **Ti → Tj**
3. **Check for cycles**:

   * If **acyclic** → schedule is **conflict-serializable**
   * If **cycle exists** → schedule is **not** conflict-serializable

---

### 🧪 GATE-Style Example

**Schedule S**:

```
R1(X); W2(X); R1(Y); W2(Y); W1(Y);
```

🧠 Conflicts:

* W2(X) after R1(X) → T1 → T2
* W2(Y) after R1(Y) → T1 → T2
* W1(Y) after W2(Y) → T2 → T1

📌 Edges:

* T1 → T2
* T2 → T1

⚠️ Cycle exists ⇒ ❌ Not conflict-serializable

## 🔐 View vs Conflict Serializability

| Feature                      | Conflict Serializability | View Serializability |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Based on operation conflicts | ✅                        | ❌                    |
| Graph-based test             | ✅ Easy                   | ❌ Hard               |
| Strict                       | ✅ More strict            | ❌ More general       |
| GATE Focus                   | 🔥 High                  | ❄️ Low               |

## 🎯 GATE Strategy for Schedules

| Tip                        | Explanation                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Count conflicts accurately | Watch read-write and write-write conflicts |
| Draw Precedence Graph      | Visual tool to quickly check for cycles    |
| Avoid "assumption errors"  | Conflicts must be for **same data item**   |
| ==Remember: order matters==    | ==R1(X) then W2(X) ≠ W2(X) then R1(X)==        |

| Concept                      | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Schedule**                 | Sequence of operations from multiple transactions               |
| **Conflict Serializability** | Equivalent to a serial schedule by swapping non-conflicting ops |
| **Conflict**                 | Two ops on same data item, one of them is a write               |
| **Precedence Graph**         | Nodes = transactions; edges = conflicting dependencies          |
| **Acyclic Graph**            | Schedule is conflict-serializable                               |
| **Cycle Exists**             | Not serializable, may produce inconsistent state                |
