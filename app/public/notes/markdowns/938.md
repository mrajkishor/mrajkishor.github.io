## üß± Building a Scalable Stateful Web App: MyWordPress.com

In this case study, we‚Äôre designing a **fully scalable and highly available WordPress application** ‚Äî the classic example of a stateful web app that needs to persist user uploads, blog content, and configuration. Let‚Äôs break down the key architectural components used to make this possible.

---

### üéØ Goal of This Architecture

We want:

* A **scalable WordPress app** that can handle traffic across regions.
* The ability to **store and serve user-uploaded images** properly.
* A **reliable database layer** to persist blog content and user data.
* A setup that gracefully supports **auto-scaling**, **high availability**, and **fault tolerance**.

---

## üîß 1. Base Infrastructure ‚Äì RDS with Multi-AZ

To start with, we set up:

* An **Auto Scaling Group** of EC2 instances (M5 type) deployed across **multiple Availability Zones (AZs)**.
* A **Load Balancer (ELB)** that routes user traffic to available EC2s.
* A **Route 53** DNS service for intelligent routing and health checks.
* A **MySQL RDS instance** with **Multi-AZ deployment**, ensuring database failover support.

### üß† Why RDS Multi-AZ?

* Multi-AZ doesn't improve performance, but **increases resilience**.
* It provides **automatic failover** in case the primary DB goes down.

---

## üöÄ 2. Scaling Database with Amazon Aurora + Read Replicas

As traffic grows, plain RDS isn't enough. So, we upgrade to **Amazon Aurora MySQL**, which is designed for high throughput and replication.

Key upgrades:

* Aurora is deployed with **Multi-AZ** for HA (like RDS).
* **Read Replicas** allow read-heavy operations (like blog visitors) to be offloaded from the main writer node.

### üß† Why Aurora + Read Replicas?

* Aurora is **5x faster than standard MySQL**.
* Read replicas provide **horizontal scaling for read operations**.
* Write performance remains centralized to the primary writer node.

## üñºÔ∏è 3. Storing Images ‚Äî The EBS vs EFS Dilemma

WordPress supports image uploads (media library). These images need **persistent block storage** across EC2 instances.

---

### üì¶ Option A: Storing Images on EBS (Amazon Elastic Block Store)

Initially, each EC2 instance has its own **EBS volume** attached:

* EBS is **AZ-scoped and bound to a specific EC2 instance**.
* If the instance is terminated or scaled out to another AZ, images won't be accessible from there.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:

* High performance
* Good for **single-instance apps**

#### ‚ùå Cons:

* Not shareable across instances or AZs
* Limits **horizontal scaling**

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Option B: Using EFS (Amazon Elastic File System)

To support scaling across instances and AZs, we move to **EFS**:

* EFS is a **fully managed NFS file system**.
* It can be **mounted simultaneously** to multiple EC2s across AZs using **ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)**.
* This ensures every instance has access to the same image storage.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:

* Shared storage across all AZs
* Perfect for **distributed WordPress clusters**
* Auto-scaling storage and consistent performance

#### ‚ùå Cons:

* Slightly higher latency than EBS
* More expensive in certain cases

## üìä TL;DR ‚Äì Key Architectural Decisions

| Component               | Purpose                         | Why It Matters                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Route 53                | DNS routing & health checks     | Ensures traffic hits healthy endpoints        |
| Elastic Load Balancer   | Distributes traffic to EC2s     | Enables horizontal scaling                    |
| EC2 (M5) + Auto Scaling | Runs WordPress app              | Scales based on demand across AZs             |
| RDS MySQL Multi-AZ      | Stores WordPress data           | HA and failover support                       |
| Aurora + Read Replicas  | Scalable DB setup               | Separates read/write, improves performance    |
| EBS                     | Local image storage (basic)     | Simple but not scalable                       |
| EFS                     | Shared image storage (advanced) | Best for stateless compute + persistent media |

## üß† Final Thought

This architecture shows the **evolution of thinking like a Solutions Architect** ‚Äî from choosing the right compute strategy to balancing persistence, availability, and scale.

If you‚Äôre ever tasked with deploying a stateful app like WordPress, this kind of layered approach ensures you‚Äôre:

* Designing for **resilience**
* Thinking ahead for **scaling**
* Making your application **future-proof**
