# üö¶ **Blocking vs Non-Blocking Sagas**

Once you start working with real-world async workflows ‚Äî API calls, polling, user interactions, or background sync ‚Äî you‚Äôll eventually run into the question:

> ‚ÄúShould this saga block the rest of the flow, or should it run in the background?‚Äù

This is the key difference between **blocking** and **non-blocking** sagas.

If you‚Äôre interviewing or working on a Enterprise-level frontend system, knowing when and how to use them is essential for building **clean, predictable, and performant async flows**.

Let‚Äôs break it down.

---

## üîë The Core Idea

In Redux-Saga, you write **generator functions** (`function*`) and use effects like `call()`, `fork()`, etc. The effect you choose determines whether a saga:

* **waits (blocks)** until a task finishes before moving forward
  ‚Üí `call()`
* **starts it and continues immediately (non-blocking)**
  ‚Üí `fork()`

---

## üß± Blocking Sagas ‚Äî `call()`

```js
const result = yield call(api.fetchUser, userId);
```

This **pauses** the current saga until the call is complete (or errors out).

### ‚úÖ When to Use:

* When you need to **wait for a result before continuing**
* When tasks **depend on one another**
* When you need **sequential execution**

### üîç Real Example:

```js
function* submitOrderSaga(action) {
  // Block until order is submitted
  const response = yield call(api.submitOrder, action.payload);

  // Only proceed if order succeeded
  yield put({ type: "ORDER_SUCCESS", payload: response });
}
```

Here, if the API call fails, nothing else runs. That‚Äôs the point: it‚Äôs controlled, linear, and safe.

---

## üîÑ Non-Blocking Sagas ‚Äî `fork()`

```js
const task = yield fork(syncUserData, userId);
```

This **starts a new task in parallel** and immediately continues execution of the parent saga.

### ‚úÖ When to Use:

* When tasks are **independent**
* For **background jobs** or side tasks
* When you might want to **cancel** the task later

### üîç Real Example:

```js
function* appInitSaga() {
  yield fork(syncUserData);     // background
  yield fork(listenForUpdates); // background
  yield call(loadAppShell);     // blocking
}
```

Here, user data and WebSocket listeners spin up **non-blocking**, while the shell blocks until loaded.

---

## ü§Ø So‚Ä¶ What Happens If You Mix?

```js
function* example() {
  yield fork(taskA); // runs in background
  yield call(taskB); // waits for taskB before continuing
}
```

`taskA` and `taskB` will both run ‚Äî but `taskB` **must finish before** the saga moves forward.
`taskA` may still be running when the saga moves ahead ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay if they‚Äôre unrelated.

## üß† Why It Matters in Enterprise-Scale Apps

| Blocking (`call`)                  | Non-Blocking (`fork`)                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Easier to read, reason about       | Enables concurrency and performance      |
| Forces linear, predictable flow    | Can improve responsiveness and UX        |
| Safer for transactional operations | Great for polling, subscriptions, queues |
| Fails together (cascades on error) | Isolated: can recover independently      |

You use blocking when:

* You need to ensure success before continuing
* One task **depends** on the result of another
* It‚Äôs a **critical operation** (auth, checkout, payment)

You use non-blocking when:

* Tasks run **independently**
* You want to **run multiple sagas at once**
* You need the ability to **cancel** tasks

---

## üîß Practical Use Case: Polling in Background

```js
function* pollData() {
  while (true) {
    const data = yield call(api.fetchData);
    yield put({ type: "POLL_SUCCESS", payload: data });
    yield delay(10000); // wait 10 seconds
  }
}

function* watchPolling() {
  yield take("START_POLLING");
  yield fork(pollData); // don‚Äôt block the rest of the app
}
```

Imagine if we used `call(pollData)` here ‚Äî the app would hang until polling ends (which it never does).

---

## üõë Cancellation Only Works with `fork()`

You **cannot** cancel a task that‚Äôs blocking with `call()`.

```js
const task = yield fork(backgroundTask);

// some condition
yield cancel(task); // ‚úÖ works
```

But if you did:

```js
yield call(backgroundTask);
yield cancel(backgroundTask); // ‚ùå this doesn‚Äôt work!
```

That‚Äôs because `call` waits and doesn‚Äôt give you a cancelable handle. **Only fork returns a task descriptor** you can control.

---

## üîÅ Quick Comparison Table

| Feature          | `call(fn)`       | `fork(fn)`                |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Blocking         | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚ùå No                      |
| Waits for result | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚ùå No                      |
| Testable         | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚úÖ Yes                     |
| Returns          | Function result  | Task descriptor           |
| Cancelable       | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes (with `cancel()`)   |
| Use case         | Sequential flows | Background/parallel flows |

## ‚úÖ Summary

* `call()` = blocking, waits for the result ‚Üí great for step-by-step logic
* `fork()` = non-blocking, runs in parallel ‚Üí great for concurrent, cancelable work
* **Use call** for ordered, dependent, and critical actions
* **Use fork** for polling, websockets, long-running background tasks
* Combine with `cancel()` and `race()` to build robust async logic

### Important Patterns:

Let‚Äôs explore some **highly practical Redux-Saga patterns**:

---

# üîÅ React / Redux / Redux-Saga / **Patterns: Polling, Debounce, Upload Cancel**

These patterns help you control **user interactions**, **network load**, and **UX responsiveness**. They‚Äôre real-world tools you‚Äôll reach for daily ‚Äî and they demonstrate **engineering maturity** in interviews and production apps.

---

## üîÑ 1. **Polling Pattern**

> Repeatedly fetch data at intervals (e.g., live dashboard updates)

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Real-time dashboards
* Live stock tickers
* Auto-refreshing tables

### üîß Implementation:

```js
import { call, delay, put, take, fork, cancel } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { fetchMetrics } from "../api";

function* pollMetrics() {
  try {
    while (true) {
      const data = yield call(fetchMetrics);
      yield put({ type: "METRICS_SUCCESS", payload: data });
      yield delay(10000); // Wait 10 seconds before next poll
    }
  } catch (e) {
    yield put({ type: "METRICS_FAILED", error: e });
  }
}

export function* watchPolling() {
  while (true) {
    yield take("START_POLLING");
    const task = yield fork(pollMetrics);

    yield take("STOP_POLLING");
    yield cancel(task); // cancels the poll loop
  }
}
```

### üß† Key Points:

* `fork()` allows polling to run in the background
* `cancel()` stops it cleanly when needed (e.g., user navigates away)
* `delay(ms)` pauses between calls

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è 2. **Debounce Pattern**

> Wait for a pause in user input before firing action ‚Äî especially useful in search.

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Autocomplete
* Filtering product lists
* Instant form validation

### üîß Implementation:

```js
import { call, put, delay, takeLatest } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { searchApi } from "../api";

function* handleSearch(action) {
  yield delay(300); // Wait for 300ms pause
  const result = yield call(searchApi, action.payload.query);
  yield put({ type: "SEARCH_SUCCESS", payload: result });
}

export function* watchSearchInput() {
  yield takeLatest("SEARCH_QUERY_CHANGED", handleSearch);
}
```

### üß† Key Points:

* `delay()` is like a debounce timer
* `takeLatest()` ensures only the latest search is processed ‚Äî older ones are **canceled**
* Prevents spamming API on every keystroke

---

## üì§ 3. **Cancelable File Upload Pattern**

> Cancel a long-running operation (e.g., user clicks ‚ÄúCancel Upload‚Äù)

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* File uploads
* Long-running async operations
* Network-intensive jobs

### üîß Implementation:

```js
import { call, put, take, fork, cancel } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { uploadFile } from "../api";

function* uploadSaga(action) {
  try {
    const response = yield call(uploadFile, action.payload.file);
    yield put({ type: "UPLOAD_SUCCESS", payload: response });
  } catch (error) {
    yield put({ type: "UPLOAD_FAILED", error });
  }
}

export function* watchUpload() {
  while (true) {
    const action = yield take("START_UPLOAD");
    const task = yield fork(uploadSaga, action);

    const result = yield take(["CANCEL_UPLOAD", "UPLOAD_SUCCESS", "UPLOAD_FAILED"]);

    if (result.type === "CANCEL_UPLOAD") {
      yield cancel(task);
      yield put({ type: "UPLOAD_CANCELED" });
    }
  }
}
```

### üß† Key Points:

* `fork()` starts the upload in background
* `take()` watches for cancel or success
* `cancel()` halts the task mid-flight

| Pattern         | Tooling                  | Use Case Examples                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Polling**     | `while(true) + delay`    | Live dashboards, chat refresh, health checks |
| **Debounce**    | `delay + takeLatest`     | Search input, instant filters                |
| **Cancel Task** | `fork + cancel + take()` | File uploads, form submit, media playback    |

## üéØ Interview-Ready Takeaways

* These patterns **demonstrate async task control**: when to start, pause, delay, or cancel
* They show your ability to **manage resource efficiency** (no API spam, no orphaned requests)
* They‚Äôre **standard at scale** ‚Äî almost every Enterprise app does this internally
