## âœ… **4.1 Physical Layer Transmission Media**

The **Physical Layer** of the OSI model is responsible for the **actual transmission of data** over a communication channel. Transmission media refers to the **physical path** between sender and receiver through which the data travels.

### ðŸ”Œ Types of Transmission Media:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Twisted Pair Cable**

* **Structure**: Two copper wires twisted together; available as UTP (Unshielded) and STP (Shielded).
* **Use Case**: Ethernet, telephone lines.
* **Categories**: Cat5e (1 Gbps), Cat6/Cat6a (10 Gbps), Cat7+.
* **Advantages**:

  * Inexpensive, flexible, easy to install
  * PoE (Power over Ethernet) support
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Limited range (\~100m without repeaters)
  * Susceptible to interference (UTP)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Coaxial Cable**

* **Structure**: Central copper conductor, insulation, metallic shield, outer jacket.
* **Use Case**: Cable TV, broadband internet.
* **Advantages**:

  * Better noise resistance than twisted pair
  * Higher bandwidth
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Bulkier and costlier than UTP

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Optical Fibre**

* **Structure**: Glass/plastic core surrounded by cladding, buffer, and jacket.
* **Use Case**: High-speed internet, backbone networks, data centers.
* **Advantages**:

  * High bandwidth (Gbps/Tbps)
  * Long-distance, low-loss transmission
  * Immune to EMI
  * Highly secure (hard to tap)
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Expensive and complex to install
  * Fragile compared to copper

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Wireless Communication**

* **Medium**: Electromagnetic waves (radio, infrared, microwave).
* **Technologies**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 4G/5G.
* **Advantages**:

  * No cables, portable, flexible
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Lower speed compared to wired
  * Vulnerable to interference and security risks

---

## âœ… **4.2 Switching Methods**

**Switching** refers to how data is transferred from source to destination within a network.

### ðŸ”„ 1. **Circuit Switching**

* **Mechanism**: Dedicated path is established before communication begins.
* **Use Case**: Traditional telephone systems.
* **Advantages**:

  * Consistent performance (fixed path)
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Inefficient resource use when idle

---

### ðŸ“¦ 2. **Packet Switching**

* **Mechanism**: Data is divided into packets; each packet takes an independent path.
* **Use Case**: Internet, LANs.
* **Advantages**:

  * Efficient bandwidth usage
  * Supports many users
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Variable latency and jitter

---

### ðŸ’¬ 3. **Message Switching**

* **Mechanism**: Entire message stored at intermediate node, then forwarded (store-and-forward).
* **Use Case**: Obsolete, but concept used in email systems.
* **Advantages**:

  * No need for a dedicated path
* **Disadvantages**:

  * High delay and storage needs

| **Multiple Channels**              | B-channel (data/voice) + D-channel (signaling)           |
| **Types**                          |                                                          |
| - **BRI (Basic Rate Interface)**   | 2B + 1D (ideal for home/SMEs)                            |
| - **PRI (Primary Rate Interface)** | 23B + 1D (NA) / 30B + 1D (EU); used by large enterprises |
| **Terminal Adapters**              | Allow analog devices to connect to digital ISDN lines    |

### ðŸ’» **4.3.2 Terminal Handling**

**Terminal handling** refers to **managing communication** between end-user devices and the network.

### Functions:

| Function                   | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Terminal Emulation**     | Mimics a remote terminal to access host systems      |
| **Protocol Support**       | Supports Telnet, SSH for remote login                |
| **Data Efficiency**        | Manages encoding, error handling, and flow control   |
| **Network Administration** | Controls terminal access, monitoring, authentication |

### Benefits:

* Smooth data exchange between user and network
* Secure and structured communication
* Allows use of legacy terminals with modern systems
