# 🧩 Using Module Federation with Next.js: Micro Frontends the Modern Way

## 🧭 Introduction

As web applications scale, so does the complexity of their frontend codebase. Teams working on different features often struggle with coordination, deployment bottlenecks, and shared code maintenance. The solution? **Micro Frontends** — and the most powerful enabler of this architecture today is **Module Federation**.

In this post, we’ll explore how **Module Federation** works with **Next.js**, the popular React framework, and how it enables independently deployable frontend apps that feel like a single unit.

## 🧠 What is Module Federation?

**Module Federation** is a feature of **Webpack 5** that allows multiple applications (or “remotes”) to:

- **Expose their components/modules** to other apps
- **Consume code** from remote applications at runtime

Think of it as **dynamic `import()` from another app** — enabling true micro frontend architecture.

> Example: App A can consume a Navbar or Auth module from App B without bundling it at build time.

## 🔧 Why Use Module Federation with Next.js?

Next.js supports Webpack 5 out of the box, which means you can use Module Federation to:

- Break monolith frontends into independent parts
- Enable **team-based ownership**
- Deploy features independently
- Share common libraries (like React) across apps
- Achieve **runtime integration** across domains

## 🧱 Common Micro Frontend Setup

| Role      | Description                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Host App  | The container that loads remote apps dynamically     |
| Remote App| Exposes components (e.g. `Navbar`, `Auth`, etc.)     |
| Shared    | Common libraries like `react`, `react-dom`, etc.     |

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup

Let’s say you have:

- A **Host App** (e.g. dashboard)
- A **Remote App** (e.g. navbar or marketing component)

### 1. Configure `next.config.js` in Both Apps

#### 🔹 Host App: `next.config.js`

```js
const { NextFederationPlugin } = require('@module-federation/nextjs-mf');

module.exports = {
  webpack(config) {
    config.plugins.push(
      new NextFederationPlugin({
        name: 'host',
        remotes: {
          navbar: 'navbar@http://localhost:3001/_next/static/chunks/remoteEntry.js',
        },
        shared: {
          react: { singleton: true },
          'react-dom': { singleton: true },
        },
      })
    );
    return config;
  },
};
```

#### 🔹 Remote App: `next.config.js`

```js
const { NextFederationPlugin } = require('@module-federation/nextjs-mf');

module.exports = {
  webpack(config) {
    config.plugins.push(
      new NextFederationPlugin({
        name: 'navbar',
        filename: 'static/chunks/remoteEntry.js',
        exposes: {
          './NavBar': './components/NavBar',
        },
        shared: {
          react: { singleton: true },
          'react-dom': { singleton: true },
        },
      })
    );
    return config;
  },
};
```

### 2. Consume Remote Component in Host

In your Host App page or component:

```js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const RemoteNavBar = dynamic(() => import('navbar/NavBar'), { ssr: false });

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <RemoteNavBar />
      <h1>Welcome to Host App</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

> You use `dynamic()` with `ssr: false` because remote modules are fetched at runtime and can't be statically analyzed by Next.js for SSR.

---

### 3. Run Apps on Different Ports

```bash
# Remote (navbar)
PORT=3001 npm run dev

# Host (dashboard)
PORT=3000 npm run dev
```

Ensure **CORS and public paths** are configured properly if hosting on different domains.

## 🛡️ Key Considerations

| Concern         | Solution                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| SSR Compatibility | Use `ssr: false` with dynamic imports for now          |
| Shared Libraries | Use `singleton: true` for core libs like React          |
| Routing Conflicts | Use Next.js basePath or custom routing strategies      |
| Deployment       | Host remoteEntry.js on a CDN or static server           |

---

## 📦 Tools That Help

- [`@module-federation/nextjs-mf`](https://github.com/module-federation/universe/tree/main/packages/nextjs-mf) — Core plugin for Next.js support
- `Module Federation Dashboard` — Monitor and version micro frontends
- `Turborepo / Nx` — Manage mono-repos with shared code

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Shared Navbars, Footers, Auth across apps
- Migrating monolith to micro frontend gradually
- Embedding marketing sites, blog engines into app shell
- Feature teams working in isolation

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Module Federation + Next.js gives you a powerful platform for scaling frontend development. It enables **truly independent deployment**, **faster dev cycles**, and **better team autonomy** — without sacrificing UX.

> Micro frontends used to be hard. With Module Federation, it’s almost plug-and-play.
