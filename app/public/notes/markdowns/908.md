# ‚öôÔ∏è **Setting Up Redux-Saga Middleware**

Once you understand what Redux-Saga is and why it's powerful, the next step is actually wiring it up into your React + Redux project.

Redux-Saga is a middleware, so it fits **between dispatching an action and the reducer processing it** ‚Äî catching certain actions and performing custom logic (like API calls, retries, or cancellations) before any state update happens.

Let‚Äôs walk through how to **set up Redux-Saga** from scratch in a real-world, production-grade React app.

---

## üì¶ Step 1: Install Redux-Saga

First, install the package:

```bash
npm install redux-saga
# or
yarn add redux-saga
```

It assumes you already have:

* React
* Redux
* `react-redux`
* A basic Redux store

If not, set those up first (let me know if you need that as well).

---

## üîß Step 2: Create Your Root Saga

A **saga** is a generator function that can listen for dispatched actions and perform side effects.

Start by creating a `sagas` folder with a `rootSaga.js` (or `.ts` if you're using TypeScript):

```js
// src/sagas/rootSaga.js
import { all } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { watchLogin } from "./authSaga";
import { watchCart } from "./cartSaga";

export default function* rootSaga() {
  yield all([
    watchLogin(),
    watchCart(),
    // Add more watchers here
  ]);
}
```

* `all()` lets you run multiple sagas in parallel
* Each watcher saga listens for specific actions

---

## üß© Step 3: Create a Watcher Saga

A watcher saga listens for dispatched actions and fires a **worker** saga to handle them.

Example:

```js
// src/sagas/authSaga.js
import { takeEvery, call, put } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { loginApi } from "../api";

// worker saga
function* handleLogin(action) {
  try {
    const response = yield call(loginApi, action.payload);
    yield put({ type: "LOGIN_SUCCESS", payload: response });
  } catch (error) {
    yield put({ type: "LOGIN_FAILURE", error });
  }
}

// watcher saga
export function* watchLogin() {
  yield takeEvery("LOGIN_REQUEST", handleLogin);
}
```

You can create similar files for cart, products, orders, etc.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 4: Connect Redux-Saga to Your Redux Store

Open your `store.js` (or `store.ts`) file where your Redux store is created.

```js
// src/store.js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from "redux";
import createSagaMiddleware from "redux-saga";
import rootReducer from "./reducers";
import rootSaga from "./sagas/rootSaga";

// 1. Create the middleware
const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();

// 2. Apply the middleware to the store
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  compose(applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware))
);

// 3. Run the saga
sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);

export default store;
```

* `createSagaMiddleware()` creates the middleware
* You add it to Redux using `applyMiddleware()`
* Then, you **run** your saga entry point with `sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga)`

---

## üîÑ Step 5: Wire Store to React (If Not Already)

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

This makes your store (and saga middleware) available to all components via `useDispatch` and `useSelector`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                           | Why It Fails                                              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forgetting `sagaMiddleware.run()` | Sagas never start, nothing listens for your actions       |
| Not using `yield` in generator    | Saga breaks ‚Äî generators need `yield` to pause & resume   |
| Using `call(api)` without `yield` | Nothing happens, or silent runtime errors                 |
| Dispatching wrong action types    | Saga never catches the action (always double-check types) |
| Using `.then()` inside sagas      | Misses the whole point ‚Äî **use `yield call()` instead**   |

---

## üî¨ What‚Äôs Happening Under the Hood?

When you dispatch an action like `LOGIN_REQUEST`, here's what happens:

1. Redux-Saga sees the action via `takeEvery()`
2. It runs your generator function (e.g., `handleLogin`)
3. That saga uses `call()` to perform the async logic (e.g., API call)
4. Then it uses `put()` to dispatch new actions based on the outcome

Sagas **never modify state directly** ‚Äî they dispatch actions, and reducers handle those actions to update the state.

## üß† Best Practices

| Best Practice                                 | Why It Matters at Scale                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Split sagas by domain (auth, cart, etc.)      | Keeps logic modular and testable                         |
| Use `call()` for all async calls              | Allows easy mocking in tests and consistent control flow |
| Centralize all watcher sagas in `rootSaga.js` | Makes it scalable and readable for large teams           |
| Create ‚Äúworker + watcher‚Äù pairs               | Clear separation of listener and logic                   |
| Avoid logic in components                     | Keep your components dumb ‚Äî sagas handle business logic  |

## ‚úÖ Summary

* Install and import `redux-saga` and set up the middleware
* Create a root saga that combines multiple watcher sagas
* Use `takeEvery`, `call`, and `put` inside generator functions to manage side effects
* Connect saga middleware to Redux and run your root saga
* Follow domain-driven structure for scale and clarity
