### 🛠️ Microfrontend Frameworks and Tools – **Single-SPA**

---

#### 🔹 What is Single-SPA?

**Single-SPA (Single Single-Page Application)** is a **framework for orchestrating multiple microfrontends** built with different frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) into a single cohesive frontend.

It acts as a **microfrontend router**, allowing multiple apps to coexist on the same page while maintaining their own lifecycles and frameworks.

> 📌 Think of it as a **frontend "OS"** that loads and unloads apps dynamically based on the current route.

### 🎯 Key Features

| Feature                    | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 Multi-framework support | Works with **React, Angular, Vue, Svelte**, or vanilla JS   |
| 🔄 Lifecycle orchestration | Defines app lifecycles like `bootstrap`, `mount`, `unmount` |
| 🌐 Route-based loading     | Loads MFEs based on route (e.g., `/orders`, `/cart`)        |
| 💥 Lazy loading            | Loads only the active MFE, improving performance            |
| 🧪 App isolation           | Each app runs independently in its own scope                |

### 🧱 Architecture Overview

```txt
           +-----------------------+
           |     Root Config App   |
           +-----------------------+
                     |
         --------------------------
        |            |             |
    React App    Angular App    Vue App
   (Cart MFE)   (Profile MFE)   (Home MFE)
```

* The **Root Config** app is the shell that registers and loads microfrontends dynamically.

---

### 🧪 Example Microfrontend Registration

```js
import { registerApplication, start } from 'single-spa';

registerApplication({
  name: 'cart',
  app: () => System.import('http://localhost:3001/cart.js'),
  activeWhen: ['/cart'],
});

registerApplication({
  name: 'profile',
  app: () => System.import('http://localhost:3002/profile.js'),
  activeWhen: ['/profile'],
});

start();
```

### ✅ When to Use Single-SPA

* You need to **combine apps written in different frontend frameworks**
* Your organization has **multiple teams** using their own tech stacks
* You want **independent deployments** and **routing-based MFE loading**
* You prefer **fine-grained lifecycle control**

---

### ⚙️ Microfrontend Lifecycle Hooks

Each MFE must export:

```js
export function bootstrap(props) { ... }
export function mount(props) { ... }
export function unmount(props) { ... }
```

These allow `single-spa` to orchestrate when and how each MFE loads.

### 🧠 Strengths

| Strength                    | Why it matters                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 Framework-agnostic       | Ideal for polyglot teams               |
| 📦 Lightweight              | Doesn’t enforce bundler or framework   |
| ⚙️ Lifecycle control        | Precise control over app bootstrapping |
| 🚀 Lazy loading and routing | Efficient for large apps               |

### ⚠️ Challenges

| Challenge                        | Mitigation                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔁 Manual configuration overhead | Use helpers like `single-spa-react`, `single-spa-angular`    |
| ❌ No built-in module sharing     | Needs SystemJS or external libraries for shared dependencies |
| 🚫 Not SEO-friendly by default   | Requires extra setup for SSR                                 |
| 🧪 Harder integration testing    | Each app is deployed independently — requires mock setup     |

### 🔧 Tools & Ecosystem

| Package                | Use Case                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `single-spa`           | Core framework                            |
| `single-spa-react`     | Lifecycle helpers for React               |
| `single-spa-angular`   | Lifecycle helpers for Angular             |
| `single-spa-vue`       | Lifecycle helpers for Vue                 |
| `import-map-overrides` | Switch remotes at runtime (for local dev) |

---

### 🌍 Real-World Examples

* **Canopy** – Enterprise dashboard built with multiple frameworks
* **DAZN** – Streams microfrontends using `single-spa` + `import-map-overrides`
* **Open Learning** – Modular e-learning platform using single-spa with React/Angular

---

### 📌 When Not to Use

* If your entire app is written in a **single framework** (e.g., all React) and you don’t need MFE orchestration.
* If you're already using **Webpack Module Federation**, which provides **runtime module sharing** without routing logic.
* If your app requires **server-side rendering out-of-the-box** (SSR support is manual).
