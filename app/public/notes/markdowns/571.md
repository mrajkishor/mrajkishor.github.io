# 🛡️ Rate Limiting in Express.js: Protecting Your API from Abuse

Modern web applications are exposed to the internet and, by extension, to the risk of **abuse**, **DDoS attacks**, and **brute-force login attempts**. One of the simplest and most effective ways to mitigate these threats is by implementing **Rate Limiting** — a technique that restricts the number of requests a client can make within a given timeframe.

In this guide, we'll explore what rate limiting is, why it's important, and how to implement it in your Express.js application using battle-tested tools.

## 🧠 What is Rate Limiting?

**Rate limiting** restricts how many requests a user/IP/client can make to your API within a defined time window.

### ✅ Example:

> Limit: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
> If a client exceeds that, respond with `429 Too Many Requests`.

## 🔐 Why Use Rate Limiting?

| Reason                        | Benefit                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Prevent brute-force attacks   | Stop password guessing on login endpoints   |
| Protect server resources      | Block abusive clients or bots               |
| DDoS mitigation (basic level) | Prevent app from being flooded with traffic |
| Fair usage enforcement        | Ensure all users get fair access            |

## 🚀 Installing a Rate Limiter in Express

We'll use the popular [`express-rate-limit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit) middleware.

### 📦 Install:

```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```

---

## ⚙️ Basic Setup

```js
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

// Create rate limiter
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.',
});

// Apply globally
app.use(limiter);
```

✅ Now all routes are protected with a 100-requests-per-15-minutes rule.

---

## 🎯 Apply to Specific Routes Only

You might want to protect only sensitive routes like login:

```js
const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  max: 5,
  message: 'Too many login attempts. Try again in 5 minutes.',
});

app.post('/login', loginLimiter, loginHandler);
```

---

## 🔄 Customize Response Format

```js
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 10 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 50,
  handler: (req, res) => {
    res.status(429).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'You are sending requests too quickly. Slow down!',
    });
  },
});
```

## 🧠 Advanced Config Options

| Option         | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `windowMs`     | Time window in milliseconds                         |
| `max`          | Max requests per window per IP                      |
| `message`      | Message to send when rate limit is exceeded         |
| `headers`      | Whether to include `X-RateLimit-*` headers          |
| `keyGenerator` | Custom logic for identifying a client (default: IP) |
| `handler`      | Custom handler function for rate-limited responses  |

---

## 🔄 Rate Limiting with Redis for Scalability

For distributed apps (multiple servers), use Redis as a shared store:

```bash
npm install rate-limit-redis
```

```js
const RedisStore = require('rate-limit-redis');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  store: new RedisStore({
    sendCommand: (...args) => redisClient.call(...args),
  }),
  windowMs: 60 * 1000,
  max: 30,
});
```

> Ideal for cloud apps where memory isn’t shared across instances.

## 🚨 Best Practices

| Practice                                   | Why It's Important                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Use stricter limits on login/auth          | Prevent brute-force attacks                   |
| Don’t apply harsh limits to public content | Avoid frustrating real users                  |
| Combine with CAPTCHA or auth lockout       | For stronger security on critical routes      |
| Use Redis for multi-instance apps          | Share limits across all load-balanced servers |
| Include rate limit headers                 | Help clients adjust behavior accordingly      |

## ✅ Summary

| Feature            | Description                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Rate limiting      | Restricts number of requests per client/IP  |
| Express middleware | Implement with `express-rate-limit`         |
| Custom handlers    | Customize how the app responds when limited |
| Scoped usage       | Apply globally or per route                 |
| Redis integration  | Enables distributed rate limiting           |

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

**Rate limiting** is a must-have security layer in any public-facing API. It’s easy to implement, protects your infrastructure from abuse, and ensures fair use of resources. Combined with logging, CAPTCHA, and monitoring, rate limiting is your first line of defense against malicious traffic.
