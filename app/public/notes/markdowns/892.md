## **Chapter 4.1 – Basics of Counting Techniques**

### ✅ **Rule of Product (Multiplication Rule)**

When you’re making a series of choices, and each choice is **independent**, you multiply the number of options.

> 🔸 If you have **a** ways to do one thing, and **b** ways to do another, then there are `a × b` total ways to do both.

**Example:**
You’re ordering pizza.

* 2 crust choices: *thin*, *deep-dish*
* 3 toppings: *cheese*, *pepperoni*, *sausage*

Total combinations = `2 × 3 = 6`

So you can have:

* thin+cheese
* thin+pepperoni
* thin+sausage
* deep+cheese
* deep+pepperoni
* deep+sausage

🎯 **When to use it?** → When **both actions happen together**.

---

### ➕ **Rule of Sum (Addition Rule)**

When you have **mutually exclusive** choices (you can do either one OR the other, not both), you **add** the number of options.

> 🔸 If there are **a** ways to do something and **b** ways to do something else, and you can do only one — then there are `a + b` ways total.

**Example:**
Pizza shop gives **one free add-on**:

* 1 thick crust
* or 3 toppings

You pick **only one** of these → Total options = `1 + 3 = 4`

---

### 🔄 **Dependent Events and Factorials**

When choices depend on previous ones, use **factorials**.

> 🔸 `n!` (read as “n factorial”) is the total number of ways to arrange **n** distinct objects.

**Example:**
John has 5 different books to arrange on a shelf:

→ `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120` ways

Each book placed affects what’s left to choose next — so order matters.

---

### 🏆 **Example with Rankings:**

In a dog competition with 10 dogs, how many ways to choose **1st and 2nd place**?

* First place: 10 choices
* Second place: 9 choices (since 1 dog already taken)

→ Total = `10 × 9 = 90` ways

📌 **Tip:** When you hear *“for each…”* — that’s a sign to **multiply**.

---

### 🔢 **Permutations**

A **permutation** is about **arranging objects** where **order matters**, and **no repetition** is allowed.

---

#### 🔸 All objects:

If you’re arranging **all n** items:

> `nPn = n!`

**Example:** Permutations of “ABC”

→ ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA
→ `3! = 6` total

---

#### 🔸 Some of the objects:

Arranging **r** items out of **n**, in order:

> `nPr = n! / (n - r)!`

**Example:** 2-letter permutations of “ABC”

→ AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB
→ `3P2 = 3! / (3 - 2)! = 6`

---

### 🔘 **Combinations**

In a **combination**, **order does NOT matter**, and again, no repetition.

> 🔸 `nCr = n! / [r! × (n - r)!]`

You’re just selecting **groups**, not arranging.

**Example:** 2-letter combinations from "ABC"

→ AB = BA, AC = CA, BC = CB
So unique combos = AB, AC, BC → 3 in total

> `3C2 = 3`

---

### 🔺 **Pascal’s Triangle**

This triangle is a cool way to quickly find combination values (like C(n, r)). It also gives coefficients in binomial expansions like (a + b)ⁿ.

```
Row 0:           1
Row 1:         1   1
Row 2:       1   2   1
Row 3:     1   3   3   1
Row 4:   1   4   6   4   1
Row 5: 1   5  10  10   5   1
```

Each number is the **sum of the two numbers above it**.
For example, in row 4, position 2 (value 6) is:

> `C(4,2) = 4! / (2! × 2!) = 6`

---

**📌 Final Tip:**

* Use **product** rule when choices are made **together**
* Use **sum** rule when choices are **either-or**
* Use **factorials** for arranging items
* Use **nPr** when order **matters**
* Use **nCr** when order **doesn’t**

## **Chapter 4.2 – Pigeonhole Principle & Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**

---

### 🕳️ **Pigeonhole Principle (Simple Form)**

If you try to place **more items than containers**, at least **one container will hold more than one item**.

📌 **Put simply**:
If **n+1** pigeons are put into **n** pigeonholes, **at least one** pigeonhole will have **2 or more** pigeons.

---

### ✏️ Example 1:

**Q: What’s the minimum number of students needed to ensure that at least 3 are born in the same month?**

* There are 12 months → 12 pigeonholes
* We want **3 students in the same month** → So **k+1 = 3 ⇒ k = 2**

According to the **generalized pigeonhole principle**:
To ensure **at least one month** has 3 birthdays, we need:
`n = 12 pigeonholes` and `students ≥ 2×12 + 1 = 25`

✅ **Answer: 25 students**

---

### ✏️ Example 2:

**Q: If 13 people are in a room, show that at least two share a birth month.**

There are only 12 months.

→ 13 people into 12 months → By the pigeonhole principle,
**at least 1 month must have 2 or more people** born in it.

✅ **Conclusion: Always true with 13 people.**

---

## 🧮 **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**

This principle helps us **count how many elements are in a union of sets**, especially when some items **overlap** in multiple sets.

---

### ✏️ Example:

**Q: How many numbers from 1 to 1000 are NOT divisible by 3, 5, or 7?**

Let’s break it into sets:

* A = multiples of 3
* B = multiples of 5
* C = multiples of 7

We use:

* |A| = ⌊1000/3⌋ = **333**
* |B| = ⌊1000/5⌋ = **200**
* |C| = ⌊1000/7⌋ = **142**

Now their overlaps:

* |A∩B| = ⌊1000/15⌋ = **66**
* |B∩C| = ⌊1000/35⌋ = **28**
* |A∩C| = ⌊1000/21⌋ = **47**
* |A∩B∩C| = ⌊1000/105⌋ = **9**

Now total divisible by 3, 5, or 7 =
\= |A| + |B| + |C| − |A∩B| − |B∩C| − |A∩C| + |A∩B∩C|
\= 333 + 200 + 142 − 66 − 28 − 47 + 9 = **543**

Total not divisible = 1000 − 543 = **457**

✅ **Answer: 457 numbers**

---

## 🧩 **How Pigeonhole Principle Connects to Functions**

Let’s say you have a function f: A → B, where:

* A = pigeons (inputs)
* B = pigeonholes (targets)

We get 3 cases:

* **Case A (|A| > |B|):**
  Too many pigeons → at least one pigeonhole must hold multiple.
  ⇒ f is **surjective but not injective**
  📌 *Pigeonhole Principle lives here!*

* **Case B (|A| = |B|):**
  Perfect mapping → each pigeon in its own hole.
  ⇒ f is **bijective**

* **Case C (|A| < |B|):**
  Some holes are empty.
  ⇒ f is **injective but not surjective**

---

## 🔁 **Pigeonhole Proof (By Contradiction)**

Say you have **n pigeons** and **m pigeonholes** with **n > m**.

Suppose **no pigeonhole has more than one pigeon**.

Then:
Each pigeonhole has ≤ 1 pigeon → max pigeons = m × 1 = m

But we said n > m → ❌ Contradiction.

✅ So, **at least one pigeonhole has 2 or more pigeons**.

---

### 🔍 Real-World Example: Hair Count

> *“At least two people in California have the same number of hairs.”*

Why?

* Let’s say:

  * People in CA = over **40 million**
  * Max number of hairs on a head ≈ **1 million**

Then we have:

* 40 million people (pigeons)
* Only 1 million possible hair counts (pigeonholes)

By pigeonhole principle → some people must share the same number of hairs!

✅ **Always true**

---

## 🎲 Subset Sum Example (Advanced Pigeonhole)

> If you take any 10 numbers from 1 to 100, there will be **two subsets with the same sum.**

Why?

* Let A = set of 10 integers
* Total possible subsets = 2¹⁰ = **1024**
* Each subset has a sum from 0 to 1000 (at most) → only **1001** possible sums

1024 subsets trying to fit in 1001 possible sum values →
➡️ **At least 2 subsets must have the same sum**

✅ Pigeonhole strikes again!

---

## 🧠 Chinese Remainder Theorem (Quick Idea)

If you know:

* x ≡ a (mod m)
* x ≡ b (mod n)

... and m & n are co-prime, you can always find **x**.

Why is pigeonhole involved?

* You create a sequence like `b, b + m, b + 2m, …`
* Eventually, one of these will be ≡ a mod n
* Because you’re cycling through all mod n residues → pigeonhole principle guarantees a match!

### 4.3 Generalised Permutations and Combinations — Easy Notes

Let’s clear one thing up right away:
If **order matters**, it’s a **permutation**.
If **order doesn’t matter**, it’s a **combination**.

---

### 🔁 Permutations – When Order Matters

Permutations are all about arranging items in **different orders**. Think of arranging people in a line, creating passwords, or figuring out race positions — here, order is crucial.

**Basic formula for permutations (without repetition):**
**P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!**
Where:

* n = total items
* r = items to arrange
* ! = factorial (e.g., 4! = 4×3×2×1 = 24)

**Example:**
How many 2-letter arrangements can you make from A, B, C?
Answer: P(3,2) = 3! / (3-2)! = 6
(AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB)

---

### ♻️ Permutations with Repetition

Sometimes, items can repeat (like digits in a password). Then it’s simple:

**Formula:**
**n^r** (n to the power r)

**Example:**
3-letter words using letters from “SMOKE” (5 letters) with repetition:
\= 5^3 = **125**

---

### 🧮 Permutations of Multisets

When some items **repeat**, like in the word “BALLOON” (two Ls, two Os), we divide by the factorial of those repeats:

**Formula:**
**n! / (p1! × p2! × ... × pk!)**

**Example:**
“BALLOON” has 7 letters (n = 7), with:

* 2 Ls,
* 2 Os

So:
\= 7! / (2! × 2!) = 5040 / (2×2) = **1260**

---

### ✅ Combinations – When Order Doesn’t Matter

This is about selecting items **without caring about the order**. Think of choosing team members, lottery numbers, or flavors of ice cream.

**Formula for combinations:**
**C(n, r) = n! / (r! × (n - r)!)**

**Example:**
Choosing 2 players from S, T, U:
C(3,2) = 3! / (2! × 1!) = 3

So: ST = TS (only counted once)

---

### Real-Life Examples

* A 4-digit pin with **no repeated digits**:
  P(10,4) = 5040

* If **repetition is allowed**:
  10^4 = 10,000 combinations

---

### 💡 Special Cases

**Q: How many ways to arrange 6 kids in a line**
(i) If 2 specific kids are always together:
Treat them as one → now 5 items → 5!
The pair can be arranged in 2 ways →
**Total = 5! × 2! = 120 × 2 = 240**

(ii) If those 2 kids are never together:
Total arrangements = 6! = 720
Minus the “together” case = 720 - 240 = **480**

---

This is the foundation of counting problems in math and computer science. Just remember — always ask: *Does order matter?* That tells you whether to use permutation or combination.

### 📘 4.4 Recurrence Relations – A Friendly Explanation

A **recurrence relation** is basically a way of defining a sequence by expressing each term using previous terms in the sequence. It’s like a recipe where each step depends on what you just did. These are commonly used in computer science and mathematics to describe patterns, sequences, and algorithm runtimes.

#### 🔁 What Is a Recurrence Relation?

A recurrence relation (also called a **difference equation**) gives us a way to compute the next term of a sequence based on one or more previous terms.

**Example:**
The equation

```
f(x + 3h) + 3f(x + 2h) + 6f(x + h) + 9f(x) = 0  
```

is a recurrence relation. If we replace `f(x + h)` with something like `ar+1`, then it looks like:

```
ar+3 + 3ar+2 + 6ar+1 + 9ar = 0  
```

---

#### 📐 Order and Degree of Recurrence Relations

* **Order**: The difference between the largest and smallest subscripts. It tells us how many past values are involved.
  👉 *Example:*
  `13ar + 20ar-1 = 0` → Order is **1** (only `ar` and `ar-1` involved)

* **Degree**: The highest power of the terms involved (like exponents).
  👉 *Example:*
  `yₖ₊₃³ + 2yₖ₊₂² + 2yₖ₊₁ = 0` → Degree is **3** (due to `yₖ₊₃³`)

---

#### 🧮 Examples of Recurrence Relations

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   This is the classic example:

   ```
   F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1  
   Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂  
   ```

   Each term is the sum of the two before it.

2. **Factorial Sequence**
   Defined recursively as:

   ```
   n! = n × (n-1)!  
   0! = 1  
   ```

---

#### ✏️ General Formula

A recurrence relation is typically written like this:

```
xₙ = f(n, xₙ₋₁, xₙ₋₂, ..., xₙ₋ₖ)
```

Where:

* `xₙ` is the current term
* `k` is the order
* `f(...)` is the rule for computing it from previous terms

---

#### ✅ Solving Recurrence Relations

To solve them:

1. **Identify initial conditions** (e.g. `a₀ = 4`)
2. Use the recurrence rule to build the sequence step-by-step
3. Look for a pattern
4. Use the pattern to derive a **closed-form formula**

---

#### 🧠 Sample Problem

**Problem:** Solve

```
aₙ = aₙ₋₁ – n, where a₀ = 4
```

**Step-by-step Expansion:**

* a₁ = 4 – 1 = 3
* a₂ = 3 – 2 = 1
* a₃ = 1 – 3 = -2
* and so on...

Let’s look at the pattern of differences:

```
a₁ – a₀ = -1  
a₂ – a₁ = -2  
a₃ – a₂ = -3  
...  
```

This forms the sum:

```
an – a₀ = –(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)  
        = –n(n + 1)/2  
```

Now plug in `a₀ = 4`:

```
an = 4 – n(n + 1)/2
```

And that’s the closed-form expression!
