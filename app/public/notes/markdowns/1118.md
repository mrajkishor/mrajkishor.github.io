---

## üìå Overview

**Spring Transaction Management** is one of the most powerful features of the Spring Framework. It leverages **Spring AOP** (proxy-based aspect-oriented programming) to enable declarative transaction management using annotations or XML, keeping business logic clean while ensuring consistent **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** behavior.

Unlike traditional programmatic transaction management (e.g., manual `Connection.commit()`/`rollback()`), Spring allows declarative transactions with `@Transactional` and wraps method executions in AOP-based proxies.

---

## üîÑ How Spring AOP Handles Transactions

* Spring AOP creates a **proxy** around beans annotated with `@Transactional`.
* This proxy starts, commits, or rolls back a transaction before/after the method executes.
* If a **runtime exception** occurs (by default), the transaction is rolled back automatically.
* If no exception occurs, the transaction is committed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works Internally

1. The target bean is proxied by Spring (JDK dynamic proxy or CGLIB).
2. Before method execution:

   * The proxy checks if the method or class is annotated with `@Transactional`.
   * It uses a `TransactionInterceptor` to initiate transaction handling.
3. After method execution:

   * If the method completes successfully, transaction is committed.
   * If an exception occurs and matches rollback criteria, transaction is rolled back.

---

## üìç `@Transactional` Annotation

### üìå Default Behavior

```java
@Transactional
public void processOrder() {
    // Spring opens a transaction here
    // Business logic...
    // If no unchecked exception, Spring commits the transaction
}
```

* Transaction **committed** on success.
* Transaction **rolled back** on `RuntimeException` or `Error`.

## üß© Attributes of `@Transactional`

| Attribute       | Description                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `propagation`   | Defines how transaction boundaries are handled across nested methods |
| `isolation`     | Determines data visibility for concurrent transactions               |
| `readOnly`      | Optimizes for read-only transactions                                 |
| `timeout`       | Maximum time in seconds before forcing rollback                      |
| `rollbackFor`   | Customizes which exceptions should trigger rollback                  |
| `noRollbackFor` | Defines exceptions that shouldn‚Äôt cause rollback                     |

---

### üîÅ Propagation Types

| Type            | Behavior                                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `REQUIRED`      | Join existing transaction or create new (default)     |
| `REQUIRES_NEW`  | Suspend current and start a new transaction           |
| `NESTED`        | Execute within a nested transaction using savepoints  |
| `SUPPORTS`      | Join if one exists, else execute non-transactionally  |
| `NOT_SUPPORTED` | Suspend existing transaction, run non-transactionally |
| `NEVER`         | Throw exception if a transaction exists               |
| `MANDATORY`     | Throw exception if no transaction exists              |

---

### üîí Isolation Levels

| Level              | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT`          | Uses the database default isolation level                 |
| `READ_UNCOMMITTED` | Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads possible |
| `READ_COMMITTED`   | Prevents dirty reads                                      |
| `REPEATABLE_READ`  | Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads                   |
| `SERIALIZABLE`     | Fully isolated, most expensive                            |

---

## üí° Common Mistakes in AOP-Based Transactions

| Mistake                                          | Problem                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Calling `@Transactional` method from same class  | No proxy, so transaction is never triggered           |
| Using private/final methods for transactional    | Spring AOP cannot proxy them                          |
| Relying only on `Exception` for rollback         | Only unchecked exceptions trigger rollback by default |
| Mixing transactional and non-transactional logic | Can cause partial commits                             |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è PlatformTransactionManager Implementations

Spring delegates actual transaction work to a `PlatformTransactionManager`, such as:

| Manager Type                   | Used With                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `DataSourceTransactionManager` | Plain JDBC or Spring JDBC       |
| `JpaTransactionManager`        | JPA or Hibernate                |
| `HibernateTransactionManager`  | Native Hibernate                |
| `ChainedTransactionManager`    | Composite/multi-database setups |

---

## üß∞ XML-Based AOP Configuration for Transactions

### Sample XML:

```xml
<tx:advice id="txAdvice" transaction-manager="txManager">
  <tx:attributes>
    <tx:method name="get*" read-only="true"/>
    <tx:method name="*" rollback-for="java.lang.Exception"/>
  </tx:attributes>
</tx:advice>

<aop:config>
  <aop:pointcut id="allServices"
      expression="execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))"/>
  <aop:advisor advice-ref="txAdvice" pointcut-ref="allServices"/>
</aop:config>

<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
  <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>
```

---

## üß™ Testing Spring AOP Transactions

* Use `@Transactional` on test methods to auto-rollback between test runs.
* Use `@Commit` or `@Rollback(false)` to override.
* Use embedded databases (H2/Derby) to simulate real-world transaction behaviors.

---

## üßµ Best Practices

* Annotate methods in the **service layer**, not DAO or controller.
* Keep transaction boundaries at high-level public methods.
* Prefer `REQUIRES_NEW` for **non-critical tasks** (e.g., logging, notifications).
* Avoid calling `@Transactional` methods from within the same class.
* Always **log exceptions** that trigger rollback for observability.

## <ins>**Use case, case study, and STAR format** for:</ins>


## üß† Use Case: Ensuring Atomicity Across Service Boundaries in E-commerce Checkout

### Problem:

In a typical e-commerce system, placing an order involves:

* Saving order details
* Deducting product inventory
* Charging the payment
* Sending confirmation emails

If any of the above steps fail, the system must **roll back** all changes to avoid inconsistencies like:

* Orders saved but no inventory updated
* Payment deducted but order not placed

### Solution:

By applying `@Transactional` to the service method that orchestrates all these operations, Spring AOP ensures that:

* All DB changes are performed within a single transaction
* Any unchecked exception automatically triggers a rollback
* Non-critical tasks (like email) can be handled in separate transactions (`REQUIRES_NEW`)

---

## üìö Case Study: Transaction Management in a Loan Disbursement System

### Context:

A fintech company had a microservice responsible for disbursing loans to verified users. The process included:

1. Creating a disbursement record
2. Crediting the user‚Äôs account
3. Sending a confirmation SMS and email

### Challenges:

* Occasionally, SMS gateway failures caused the entire transaction to roll back.
* Developers wrapped everything in one transaction, including external APIs.
* This led to frequent support tickets and poor user experience.

### Implementation:

* The main disbursement logic was wrapped in `@Transactional(propagation = REQUIRED)`.
* Notification sending was moved to a separate method marked `@Transactional(propagation = REQUIRES_NEW)`.
* This allowed **critical DB operations** to succeed even if **external APIs** failed.

### Outcome:

* Reduced transaction rollback rate by **80%**
* Maintained **data integrity** while improving **resilience to failures**
* Boosted customer satisfaction and reduced support tickets

---

## üåü STAR Format

### **S ‚Äì Situation**

As a backend engineer on a financial services platform, I was responsible for implementing the loan disbursement workflow. This workflow included updating multiple database tables and triggering external API calls (email/SMS). Failures in any part often caused the entire operation to roll back, even if the failure was in a non-critical notification step.

### **T ‚Äì Task**

I had to ensure that:

* All database changes either committed successfully or rolled back as a whole
* External notification failures did not affect DB consistency
* The transaction behavior was predictable, reliable, and testable

### **A ‚Äì Action**

I refactored the main workflow method with `@Transactional` using Spring AOP. I extracted the notification logic into a separate method with `@Transactional(propagation = REQUIRES_NEW)` so that it ran in its own transaction. I also configured rollback rules for specific business exceptions and added logging to monitor transaction boundaries.

### **R ‚Äì Result**

* The system achieved **100% data consistency** even during partial failures
* Rollbacks due to non-critical errors dropped by **>80%**
* Transactional code became cleaner and more modular
* We reused this pattern across other modules like repayments and settlements

## Code Sample: 


Here‚Äôs a **complete code sample** for the **Spring AOP-based transaction management use case** described above ‚Äî disbursing a loan while ensuring atomicity for core operations and isolating non-critical failures (e.g., SMS or email notifications).

---

## ‚úÖ Goal

Ensure:

* Loan disbursal is atomic (single transaction)
* Notification failures don‚Äôt rollback disbursal
* Exceptions are logged properly
* Observability via AOP logging

Credited ‚Çπ75000.0 to user fail
üîÅ TX START: void NotificationService.sendConfirmation(..)
Sending loan confirmation to user fail
‚ùå TX ROLLBACK: void NotificationService.sendConfirmation(..) | Reason: SMS Gateway down

## üß† Notes

* The **loan disbursal transaction** commits even if **notification fails**, thanks to `REQUIRES_NEW`.
* The **AOP logger** shows transaction boundaries clearly.
* You can replace `System.out` with proper logging (SLF4J + MDC traceId).
