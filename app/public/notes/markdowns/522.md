# ⚙️ Middleware in Next.js 13+: Power at the Edge

## 🧭 Introduction

With **Next.js 13+**, Middleware has become a powerful tool to run logic **before a request reaches your route or API handler** — all at the **Edge**, close to your users. It's ideal for authentication, redirects, geolocation-based content, logging, A/B testing, and more — without slowing down your app.

---

## 🚪 What is Middleware?

**Middleware** in Next.js is a special function that executes **before a request is completed**, allowing you to modify the request or response, redirect, rewrite, or block access — **without touching your routes**.

It runs on the **Edge Runtime**, which is faster and more scalable than traditional Node.js backends.

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

You define middleware in a special file:

```
/middleware.ts (or .js)
```

It applies to all routes unless scoped via `matcher`.

---

### 🔧 Basic Example

```ts
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const url = request.nextUrl.clone();

  // Example: Redirect users from /admin if not authenticated
  const isLoggedIn = request.cookies.get('token');

  if (!isLoggedIn && url.pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
    url.pathname = '/login';
    return NextResponse.redirect(url);
  }

  return NextResponse.next(); // continue normally
}
```

---

## 🌐 Middleware Routing Scope (matcher)

You can control which routes use middleware with the `matcher` key in `middleware.config.js` or inside `export const config`.

```ts
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/admin/:path*'],
};
```

✅ More efficient  
✅ Prevents unnecessary middleware on public/static pages

## 💡 Use Cases

| Use Case                   | Example Description                                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔐 Authentication Gate     | Redirect unauthenticated users away from protected pages |
| 🌍 Geo-Based Redirection   | Redirect users to `/fr` or `/en` based on country         |
| 🧪 A/B Testing             | Serve different variants for experimentation             |
| 🎯 URL Rewriting          | Rewrite routes like `/blog/post-name` to `/api/post?slug=post-name` |
| 📊 Logging & Analytics     | Log user agent, IP, or request headers                   |

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No access to `req.body` (streams not supported in Edge)
- No support for Node.js native modules (only Edge-compatible code)
- Must be defined at the **root level** of your project
- Cannot use dynamic server-side code (e.g., DB queries)

---

## ⚡ Performance Benefit

Middleware runs on the **V8-based Edge Runtime** — closer to users, with:
- Ultra-low latency
- Cold start < 1ms
- Globally distributed execution

## 🔁 Comparison: Middleware vs API Route Middleware

| Feature                  | Next.js Middleware           | API Route Middleware (`req/res`)  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Runs Before Route Match  | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No                              |
| Runs on Edge             | ✅ Yes (Edge Runtime)         | ❌ No (Node.js)                    |
| Access to req.body       | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                             |
| Redirects / Rewrites     | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No (must handle in logic)       |

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- ✅ Use it for **routing logic**, not business logic
- ✅ Keep it **lightweight and fast**
- ❌ Avoid complex DB queries or heavy computation
- ✅ Use `matcher` to limit to necessary paths
- ✅ Leverage it for **security, UX, and performance**

---

## 📁 Example Project Structure

```
/pages
  /login.tsx
  /admin.tsx
/middleware.ts
```

With this:

```ts
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/admin/:path*'],
};
```

You can restrict `/admin` access globally.

---

## ✅ Summary

**Next.js Middleware (13+)** brings routing logic to the edge — enabling secure, fast, and user-aware requests. It’s a critical part of building scalable web apps with modern user experiences.

> Think of Middleware as the gatekeeper between your user and your app — fast, global, and powerful.
