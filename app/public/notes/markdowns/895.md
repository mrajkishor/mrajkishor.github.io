### **Chapter 7.1 – Trees: Introduction and Undirected Trees**

A **tree** is a non-linear data structure used to represent data in a **hierarchical** way. Instead of storing data in a straight line (like in arrays or linked lists), trees organize data across **levels**, from top to bottom.

---

### 🌳 **What is a Tree?**

A tree consists of **nodes** connected by **edges**. The topmost node is called the **root**, and each node may have **children**. Nodes that share the same parent are called **siblings**.

Every tree has:

* One **root node**
* Zero or more **subtrees** (smaller trees connected below)
* Connections (edges) between the parent and its children

---

### 📘 **Key Terms in a Tree Structure (with image reference)**

1. **Root Node**: The top node with no parent (example: node A)
2. **Parent Node**: A node that has one or more children (example: B is the parent of D and E)
3. **Child Node**: A node directly connected and below a parent (D and E are children of B)
4. **Siblings**: Nodes that share the same parent (D and E are siblings)
5. **Leaf Node (External Node)**: A node with no children (example: K, L, M, N, O, P)
6. **Ancestor**: Any node on the path from the root to a specific node (A and B are ancestors of E)
7. **Descendant**: Any node below a given node (E and I are descendants of B)
8. **Internal Node**: A node that has at least one child (example: B, C, D)
9. **Subtree**: Any node and all of its descendants form a subtree
10. **Level**: Distance from the root (root is level 0, children of root are level 1, and so on)

---

### 📏 **Important Tree Properties**

* **Number of Edges**: If a tree has **N nodes**, it has **N-1 edges**
* **Depth of a Node**: Number of edges from the root to that node
* **Height of a Node**: Longest path from that node to a leaf
* **Height of Tree**: Height of the root node (longest root-to-leaf path)
* **Degree of Node**: Number of children it has (leaf node’s degree = 0)
* **Tree’s Degree**: Maximum degree among all nodes
* **Traversal Methods**:

  * **DFS** (Depth First Search)
  * **BFS** (Breadth First Search)
* Trees have:

  * No loops or cycles
  * No self-loops
  * A strictly **hierarchical structure**

---

### ⚙️ **Basic Tree Operations**

* **Create** – Make a new tree
* **Insert** – Add a node or value
* **Search** – Look for a value in the tree
* **Traversals**:

  * **Preorder**: Root → Left → Right
  * **Inorder**: Left → Root → Right
  * **Postorder**: Left → Right → Root

---

### 🌐 **Undirected Trees**

An **undirected tree** is a special kind of graph where:

* There are **no cycles**
* There is **exactly one path** between any two nodes

> If you convert a directed graph into an undirected one by removing the direction of its edges, and it forms a connected structure without any cycles, it becomes an undirected tree.

This concept is also called a **polytree** when referring to its directed form (a DAG where the undirected version is a tree).

---


### **Chapter 7.2 – Binary Search Trees (BST)**

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a type of **binary tree** where each node follows a specific rule:

* All values in the **left subtree** of a node are **less** than the node’s value.
* All values in the **right subtree** are **greater** than the node’s value.

This rule is **recursively** applied to every node in the tree, making the entire structure organized for **fast searching, inserting, and deleting**.

---

### 🌲 **Properties of a Binary Search Tree**

* Every node has **at most two children**.
* The **left child’s value < parent**.
* The **right child’s value > parent**.
* Both left and right subtrees must also be valid BSTs.
* No duplicate values (no redundant nodes).

✅ Correct BST follows all rules.

❌ Incorrect BST violates ordering (see image: 13 placed to the left of 9 is invalid).

---

### 🔍 **Core Operations in BST**

1. **Search** – Efficiently find a value.
2. **Insert** – Add a new value while keeping the order.
3. **Delete** – Remove a value and rebalance if needed.
4. **Traversal** – Visit all nodes in a particular order (e.g., inorder, preorder, postorder).

---

### ⚒️ **Applications of Binary Search Trees**

#### ✅ General Use-Cases

* **Fast lookups** and dynamic data access
* **Storing sorted data** in memory
* **Indexing** in databases
* **Autocompletion** systems
* **Implementing dictionaries and symbol tables**
* **Cache systems**
* **Search algorithms** like Huffman coding

#### ✅ Real-World Applications

* **TreeMap / TreeSet in Java** use **Self-Balancing BSTs (Red-Black Tree)**.
* Used in **priority queues** and **heap-like structures**.
* Implementing **range search**, e.g., find all items priced between ₹200 and ₹500.
* **Spell checkers** that suggest closest dictionary words.
* **Online order tracking** where items are sorted by price or time.

---

### 📈 **Why Use a BST? (Advantages)**

* Efficient operations: Search, Insert, Delete in **O(log n)** (if balanced)
* Maintains **sorted order** as you insert
* Can do **range queries**
* Simple and clean to implement
* Adaptable for various uses (e.g., store additional info like frequency, timestamps)

---

### ⚠️ **Limitations (Disadvantages)**

* **Can become unbalanced**, degrading to **O(n)** time (like a linked list)
* Not ideal for **random access** (arrays are faster for that)
* More complex balancing needed (hence AVL, Red-Black Trees)
* **Some operations** supported in other ordered structures may not be directly possible
* **Worst-case performance** is poor unless tree is kept balanced

---

### 🌳 Final Thoughts

A **Binary Search Tree** gives a powerful mix of structure and speed. It’s great for datasets where quick searching and sorted order are important. However, to ensure the performance doesn’t degrade, you often need to use **self-balancing BSTs** like AVL or Red-Black Trees.

### **Chapter 7.3 – Spanning Trees**

A **spanning tree** is a simplified version of a graph that **connects all the vertices** without forming any cycles. Think of it as the skeleton of the graph—it keeps everything connected but removes all the extra loops or shortcuts.

---

### 🌳 **What Exactly Is a Spanning Tree?**

* A **spanning tree** is a **subgraph** of a connected, undirected graph.
* It **includes all the vertices** of the original graph.
* But it has **exactly (n - 1)** edges (where `n` is the number of vertices).
* There are **no cycles or loops** in a spanning tree.

🟩 If you remove even **one edge**, the tree will become **disconnected**.

🟥 If you **add an edge**, it will form a **cycle**, which violates the tree property.

---

### 🧠 **Key Properties of Spanning Trees**

1. **No Cycles** – A spanning tree is acyclic by definition.
2. **Minimal Connections** – Just enough edges to connect all vertices.
3. **Exactly (n - 1) Edges** – For `n` vertices, you’ll always have `n - 1` edges.
4. **Only for Connected Graphs** – Disconnected graphs don’t have spanning trees.
5. **Multiple Spanning Trees** – A single graph can have **many** different spanning trees.
6. **In Complete Graphs** – A complete graph with `n` vertices has `n^(n-2)` possible spanning trees.

---

### 🌍 **Real-World Applications of Spanning Trees**

Spanning trees are very useful in designing and analyzing efficient systems. Here are some practical applications:

1. **Network Design** – Laying out **electrical circuits**, **telecom lines**, or **road networks** using the minimum number of connections.
2. **Cluster Analysis** – Grouping data into clusters (used in AI and machine learning).
3. **Computer Networking** – **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** helps in avoiding cycles in Ethernet networks.
4. **Optimizing Routes** – Used in **routing algorithms** to reduce total distance or cost.

---

### 🧪 **Example Breakdown**

From the graph shown above, you can generate **multiple valid spanning trees** by picking edges that:

* Connect all the vertices
* Do not form cycles
* Use exactly 4 edges (since the graph has 5 vertices)

---

### 🧩 Summary

A **spanning tree** helps us focus on the essential structure of a graph—keeping things **connected** with the **minimum number of edges**. It’s a powerful concept used across **computer science, networking, and optimization problems**.

### **7.4 Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**

A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** is a subgraph of a connected, weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices **without any cycles**, using the **least possible total edge weight**. In simpler terms, it's the cheapest way to connect all points without loops.

#### **Key Properties**

* It spans all the vertices.
* It has exactly **(n - 1)** edges, where *n* is the number of vertices.
* It contains **no cycles**.
* Among all possible spanning trees, MST has the **lowest total weight**.

---

### **Example**

Given a graph with edge weights, various spanning trees can be formed. The MST is the one with the **minimum total sum of edge weights**.

From the image:

* The minimum spanning tree with the least weight (sum = 10) is:

  ```
  A — B (5)
  B — D (2)
  D — C (3)
  ```

---

### **Applications of MST**

1. Designing **efficient network layouts** – such as water supply, power grids, and telephone networks.
2. **Route mapping** in navigation systems.
3. **Clustering** in machine learning.
4. **Network reliability analysis** and resource optimization.

---

### **MST Algorithms**

1. **Prim’s Algorithm**

   * Starts from any vertex and grows the MST by adding the smallest weight edge that connects a visited vertex to an unvisited one.
   * Greedy and locally optimal at every step.
   * Best for **dense graphs**.

2. **Kruskal’s Algorithm**

   * Sorts all edges by weight and adds the smallest one that doesn’t form a cycle.
   * Builds the MST edge by edge.
   * Better for **sparse graphs**.

Both algorithms ensure the final result is a **globally optimal** minimum spanning tree.
