### üß© Microfrontend Design Approach ‚Äì **Fragment-Based Rendering (ESI, SSR Chunks)**

---

#### üîπ What is Fragment-Based Rendering?

**Fragment-based rendering** is a powerful technique where different **sections (fragments)** of a page are rendered independently‚Äîoften on the server‚Äîand then **stitched together to form the final HTML** sent to the browser. It enables high **performance, scalability, and composability**, especially in **microfrontend architectures**.

There are two common types:

1. **ESI (Edge Side Includes)**
2. **SSR Chunks (Server-Side Rendering Chunks)**

---

### üî∏ 1. **Edge Side Includes (ESI)**

---

#### üìò Definition:

**ESI** is a W3C specification that lets you **assemble HTML fragments at the CDN or edge server level**, rather than at the origin server.

> Think of it as server-side `include` statements handled by a CDN like Varnish, Akamai, or Fastly.

---

#### ‚úÖ Example:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <esi:include src="http://cart.example.com/cart-fragment" />
    <esi:include src="http://profile.example.com/header" />
    <main>
      <!-- SSR-rendered product listing -->
    </main>
    <esi:include src="http://footer.example.com/footer" />
  </body>
</html>
```

Each fragment is fetched and injected at **edge servers**, improving speed and reducing load on origin.

---

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:

* **Low Latency:** Rendered close to user (at CDN).
* **Independent Caching:** Cache each fragment separately (e.g., cache header for 24h, cart for 10s).
* **Team Autonomy:** Teams deploy/update fragments without affecting full page.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:

* Requires a **CDN supporting ESI** (not all do).
* Cannot execute dynamic JavaScript on the edge.
* SEO and hydration must be managed carefully.

---

### üî∏ 2. **SSR Chunks (Server-Side Rendering Chunks)**

---

#### üìò Definition:

SSR chunking involves **splitting your frontend into server-rendered chunks**, each rendered by its own microfrontend server and **combined at the backend or gateway** before sending the response.

> Think of it like assembling parts of a React/Next.js app from different servers.

---

#### ‚úÖ Example:

1. **Shell Server** fetches:

   * `Header` chunk from Auth MFE
   * `Main` chunk from Product MFE
   * `Footer` chunk from Layout MFE

2. It streams the response to the client like:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- from header-mfe SSR -->
    <div id="header">...</div>

    <!-- from product-mfe SSR -->
    <div id="main">...</div>

    <!-- from layout-mfe SSR -->
    <div id="footer">...</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:

* Works with **React SSR frameworks** like Next.js or RSC.
* Can be used with **streaming rendering** (e.g., `React 18 Suspense`, `flushToHTML()`).
* **No need for ESI CDN** ‚Äî works at the backend level.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:

* **Routing and data fetching** must be coordinated across MFE servers.
* **Hydration order** matters ‚Äî each chunk needs matching client-side code.
* Latency can increase if all chunks are fetched sequentially.

### üõ† When to Use Fragment-Based Rendering?

| Use Case                             | Recommended Technique    |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Need edge-level speed                | **ESI** with CDN         |
| Building SSR MFEs in React           | **SSR Chunks** (Next.js) |
| Fragment caching for personalization | **ESI**                  |
| Streaming React apps                 | **React SSR chunks**     |

---

### üß† Real-World Examples:

* **Netflix** uses server-side composition to stitch pages from multiple MFEs.
* **Zalando**‚Äôs Mosaic platform uses **fragment rendering** for each section of the product page.
* **IKEA** applies SSR + chunk rendering to scale MFEs with optimal SEO.

### üß≠ Summary

| Concept       | ESI                           | SSR Chunks                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Rendered At   | CDN/Edge                      | Backend Server                          |
| Use Case      | Personalized, cacheable parts | React/Next.js-based MFEs                |
| Tech Required | CDN (Akamai, Fastly, Varnish) | Node.js, React, Express/Next            |
| Benefits      | Fast, scalable, cacheable     | Flexible, SEO-friendly, modern JS stack |
| Drawbacks     | Limited logic, CDN-dependent  | Higher backend coordination complexity  |
