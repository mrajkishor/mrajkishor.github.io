## üìò Normalization ‚Äì 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF

---

### üîπ What is Normalization?

**Normalization** is a process in relational database design that aims to **eliminate data redundancy**, **reduce anomalies**, and **improve data integrity** by organizing data into well-structured tables.

Each level of normalization is called a **normal form (NF)** and introduces stricter conditions.

---

### üîπ Why Normalize?

Without normalization:

* **Data duplication** increases
* **Update anomalies** may occur (modifying a value in one place but not in others)
* **Insert/delete anomalies** may prevent or distort records

---

## üî∑ First Normal Form (1NF)

---

### ‚úÖ Definition:

A relation is in **1NF** if:

1. It has only **atomic (indivisible)** values in each cell
2. There are **no repeating groups or arrays**

---

### üß© Example (Not in 1NF):

| StudentID | Name  | Subjects      |
| --------- | ----- | ------------- |
| 101       | Raj   | Math, Physics |
| 102       | Priya | Chemistry     |

* The `Subjects` field contains **multiple values** ‚Äî **violates 1NF**

---

### ‚úÖ Convert to 1NF:

| StudentID | Name  | Subject   |
| --------- | ----- | --------- |
| 101       | Raj   | Math      |
| 101       | Raj   | Physics   |
| 102       | Priya | Chemistry |

---

## üî∑ Second Normal Form (2NF)

---

### ‚úÖ Definition:

A relation is in **2NF** if:

1. It is in **1NF**
2. **No partial dependency** exists (i.e., no non-prime attribute depends on a part of a candidate key)

---

### üî∏ Partial Dependency:

Occurs when a non-key attribute depends on **only part of a composite primary key**

---

### üß© Example (Not in 2NF):

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName | CourseName |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 101       | C101     | Raj         | DBMS       |
| 102       | C102     | Priya       | OS         |

* PK = (StudentID, CourseID)
* `StudentName` depends only on `StudentID` ‚Üí **partial dependency**
* `CourseName` depends only on `CourseID` ‚Üí **partial dependency**

---

### ‚úÖ Decompose to 2NF:

1. **Student(StudentID, StudentName)**
2. **Course(CourseID, CourseName)**
3. **Enrollment(StudentID, CourseID)**

---

## üî∑ Third Normal Form (3NF)

---

### ‚úÖ Definition:

A relation is in **3NF** if:

1. It is in **2NF**
2. There is **no transitive dependency** (i.e., non-prime attribute depends only on super key)

---

### üî∏ Transitive Dependency:

A ‚Üí B and B ‚Üí C implies A ‚Üí C
(But if B is a non-key, A ‚Üí C is a **transitive dependency**)

---

### üß© Example (Not in 3NF):

| EmpID | EmpName | DeptID | DeptName |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | Raj     | D1     | HR       |
| 2     | Priya   | D2     | IT       |

* PK = EmpID
* `DeptName` depends on `DeptID` (which depends on EmpID)
* So, `DeptName` is **transitively dependent** on EmpID

---

### ‚úÖ Decompose to 3NF:

1. **Employee(EmpID, EmpName, DeptID)**
2. **Department(DeptID, DeptName)**

---

## üî∑ Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

---

### ‚úÖ Definition:

A relation is in **BCNF** if:

1. It is in **3NF**
2. For every functional dependency **X ‚Üí Y**, **X is a super key**

> BCNF is a **stronger form** of 3NF
> It eliminates certain edge cases not covered by 3NF

---

### üß© Example (Not in BCNF):

| Course | Instructor | Room |
| ------ | ---------- | ---- |
| DBMS   | A          | R1   |
| OS     | B          | R2   |
| DBMS   | A          | R3   |

FDs:

* `Course ‚Üí Instructor` ‚úÖ
* `Room ‚Üí Course` ‚ùå (`Room` is not a super key but determines Course)

‚Üí Violates BCNF

---

### ‚úÖ Decompose into BCNF:

1. **Room(Room, Course)**
2. **Course(Course, Instructor)**

---

### ‚úÖ Summary of All Normal Forms

| Normal Form | Rule                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1NF         | Atomic values, no repeating groups   |
| 2NF         | 1NF + No partial dependencies        |
| 3NF         | 2NF + No transitive dependencies     |
| BCNF        | 3NF + LHS of every FD is a super key |

### ‚úÖ Final Thought

Normalization plays a vital role in minimizing redundancy and improving consistency in relational databases. For GATE DA, focus on:

* Understanding how dependencies impact normalization
* How to **identify** and **decompose** to higher normal forms
* Practice with **functional dependencies**, **FD diagrams**, and **MCQs**
