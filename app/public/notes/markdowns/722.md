## 📘 **State Management Best Practices in React**

---

### 🔹 1. **Understand State Types in React**

| State Type         | Description                                                  | Tools                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Local UI State** | Affects a single component (e.g., input field, modal toggle) | `useState`, `useReducer`            |
| **Shared State**   | Used across sibling or nested components                     | Lift state up or use Context        |
| **Global State**   | Needed across multiple, unrelated components                 | Context API, Redux, Zustand, Recoil |
| **Server State**   | Data fetched from an external source                         | React Query, SWR, Apollo            |
| **Derived State**  | Computed from other state/props                              | `useMemo`, computed in render       |

---

### 🔹 2. **Use the Right Tool for the Right State**

#### ✅ Best Practices:

* Prefer `useState` for simple, local data.
* Use `useReducer` for complex state logic (e.g., form w/ multiple inputs).
* Use **Context API** for stable, low-frequency global data like theme or auth.
* Use **Redux**/**Zustand**/**Recoil** for scalable, performance-sensitive global state.
* Use **React Query/SWR** for remote API state — don't store server data manually unless you need fine-grained control.

---

### 🔹 3. **Keep State Local When Possible**

* Only lift or globalize state **when truly needed**.
* Overusing global state creates tight coupling and harder debugging.

```jsx
// ✅ Ideal: Local state
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
```

---

### 🔹 4. **Lift State Up to Common Ancestor for Shared Access**

When sibling components need access to the same data:

```jsx
// Parent manages shared state
const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);
```

Use callbacks via props to update it.

---

### 🔹 5. **Avoid Redundant or Derived State**

Never store values you can compute from existing state or props.

```jsx
// ❌ Don’t do this
const [total, setTotal] = useState(price * quantity);

// ✅ Instead
const total = price * quantity;
```

---

### 🔹 6. **Normalize Global State (Entity Management)**

Use normalized structures to manage large collections:

```js
// ✅ Recommended
{
  usersById: {
    1: { id: 1, name: 'John' },
    2: { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }
  },
  allUserIds: [1, 2]
}
```

---

### 🔹 7. **Prevent Unnecessary Re-renders**

* Use `React.memo` to prevent child re-renders unless props change.
* Use `useCallback` for stable function references.
* Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations.

```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('clicked');
}, []);
```

---

### 🔹 8. **Separate UI State from Business State**

* **UI state** (modals, tabs, dropdowns) should stay local.
* **Business logic state** (cart, user, permissions) can go global.

---

### 🔹 9. **Use React DevTools and Debug Tools**

* Inspect component hierarchy and state.
* Use Redux DevTools (if using Redux) for time-travel debugging.
* Zustand/Recoil have their own dev tools.

---

### 🔹 10. **Testing State Logic**

* Use unit tests for reducers and context state.
* Test effects of state changes using React Testing Library.

## 🔍 Summary

| Principle                           | Why It Matters                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Keep state close to where it’s used | Reduces complexity and improves readability      |
| Lift state only when needed         | Avoids unnecessary prop drilling                 |
| Avoid redundant/derived state       | Keeps data consistent and predictable            |
| Use memoization wisely              | Boosts performance and prevents extra re-renders |
| Choose correct tool per need        | Keeps the codebase scalable and maintainable     |
