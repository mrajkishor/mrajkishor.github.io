## 📘 **React / State Management / Redux / Redux Store, Actions, and Reducers**

---

### 🔹 Introduction

In Redux, the global state of an application is managed through **three core components**:

> ✅ **Store** – Holds the entire application state
> ✅ **Actions** – Describe what happened
> ✅ **Reducers** – Specify how the state changes in response to actions

Together, these components implement a **predictable, centralized, and immutable** state management architecture.

---

## ✅ 1. **Redux Store**

### 🔍 What is the Store?

The **store** is a centralized object that:

* Holds the current application state
* Allows state access via `store.getState()`
* Enables state updates via `store.dispatch(action)`
* Registers listeners with `store.subscribe(listener)`

---

### 🧱 Creating a Store

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

* `createStore()` creates the Redux store.
* `rootReducer` is a combined reducer managing multiple state slices.

---

### 🧪 Accessing the Store (without React Redux)

```js
console.log(store.getState());
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
```

---

## ✅ 2. **Redux Actions**

### 🔍 What is an Action?

An **action** is a **plain JavaScript object** that describes an event or intention to change the state.

### 🧱 Basic Action Example

```js
const incrementAction = {
  type: 'INCREMENT'
};

const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  payload: 'Buy Milk'
};
```

> 🔸 Actions **must have a `type`** property
> 🔸 Optional `payload` carries data

---

### 🔄 Dispatching an Action

```js
store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: 'Learn Redux' });
```

---

### 🔧 Action Creators

To improve readability and reusability:

```js
function addTodo(payload) {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    payload
  };
}

store.dispatch(addTodo('Learn Redux'));
```

---

## ✅ 3. **Redux Reducers**

### 🔍 What is a Reducer?

A **reducer** is a **pure function** that:

* Accepts the current `state` and an `action`
* Returns a **new state** based on the action type
* Never mutates the original state

---

### 🧱 Reducer Example

```js
function counterReducer(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

---

### 🧩 Combining Multiple Reducers

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterReducer,
  todos: todosReducer
});
```

---

## 🔄 Redux Flow Summary

```txt
UI → dispatch(action) → reducer(state, action) → new state → store updates → UI re-renders
```

---

## 📌 Summary Table

| Concept     | Role                                                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Store**   | Holds global state; provides `dispatch()` and `getState()` |
| **Action**  | Describes "what happened"; must have a `type`              |
| **Reducer** | Pure function to compute new state                         |

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Always return a **new state** object in reducers
* Use **action creators** for consistency
* Avoid side effects in reducers (no API calls, etc.)
* Use Redux DevTools to trace state changes
