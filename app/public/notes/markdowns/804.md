### 🎯 What’s "Entry" in Webpack?

When you use Webpack, you're basically telling it,

> “Hey, here’s where my app starts. Go figure out the rest from here.”

That starting point is called the **entry**.

It’s usually your main JavaScript file — like `index.js` or `main.js`.
Webpack begins from there, then follows every `import` or `require` to build the whole dependency tree.

#### 👀 Example:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
}
```

You can also define **multiple entries** (like if you have separate pages or micro frontends).

```js
entry: {
  home: './src/home.js',
  dashboard: './src/dashboard.js'
}
```

This will generate separate bundles for each.

### 📦 What’s "Output"?

Once Webpack is done bundling everything, it needs to know:

> “Where should I save the result?”

That’s what **output** does. It defines:

* The **directory** where the final bundle goes (usually `dist/`)
* The **filename** of the bundle (like `main.js` or `[name].[contenthash].js`)

#### 🔧 Example:

```js
output: {
  filename: 'bundle.js',
  path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
}
```

If you're using code splitting or multiple entries, you might use:

```js
filename: '[name].[contenthash].js'
```

This gives you cache-friendly filenames like `home.123abc.js`.

### 🧠 Why This Matters

Getting `entry` and `output` right is the foundation of Webpack.
If entry is where the journey starts, output is the destination.
Everything else — loaders, plugins, optimization — revolves around this pipeline.

### 📝 Summary (in plain words)

* **Entry** = where Webpack starts reading your code
* **Output** = where it writes the bundled result
* You can have **multiple entry points** and **custom output filenames**
* Clean separation between **source files** and **build artifacts**
