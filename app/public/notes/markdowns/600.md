# 🧠 Sliding Window Technique

*A technique to optimize nested loops involving contiguous data (subarrays/substrings)*

---

## 💡 What Is a Sliding Window?

A **sliding window** is a **contiguous range** (or “window”) that **moves across a sequence** (array or string) to solve problems involving:

* Subarray/substring **lengths**
* **Maximum/minimum** in window
* **Frequency/count** tracking
* **Sum or average** in range

## 🛠️ Types of Sliding Windows

| Type             | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed-size**   | Window size `k` is constant (e.g., sum of size k) |
| **Dynamic-size** | Window expands or shrinks based on constraints    |

---

## 🔁 Sliding Window Template (Dynamic Window)

```js
let start = 0;
for (let end = 0; end < s.length; end++) {
    // Expand the window with s[end]

    // While window is invalid:
    while (/* constraint violated */) {
        // Shrink the window from start
        start++;
    }

    // Update result if needed (e.g., maxLen = Math.max(...))
}
```

---

## ➕ Fixed-size Window Template

```js
let sum = 0, maxSum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    sum += nums[i];
    if (i >= k) sum -= nums[i - k];
    if (i >= k - 1) maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
}
```

---

## 📌 Use Cases & Triggers

Use Sliding Window when you see:

* “Find max/min/longest/shortest **subarray** or **substring**”
* “Exactly/at most/at least K distinct/sum/char”
* “Fixed size or dynamic range conditions”

## 🧪 Example Problem: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

```js
function maxSum(nums, k) {
  let sum = 0, max = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    sum += nums[i];
    if (i >= k) sum -= nums[i - k];
    if (i >= k - 1) max = Math.max(max, sum);
  }
  return max;
}
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

* ❌ Off-by-one errors in window boundaries
* ❌ Forgetting to shrink the window dynamically
* ❌ Not updating frequency maps properly
* ❌ Wrong condition in while loop (can lead to infinite loops)

## ✅ Summary

| Goal                              | Use Sliding Window When...                |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Find max/min/avg in subarray      | Use fixed-size window                     |
| Longest substring with constraint | Use dynamic-size window + HashMap/HashSet |
| Find subarrays with sum/k count   | Use prefix sum or shrinkable window       |
| Track frequency/counts            | Combine with HashMap or Count Array       |

### Questions

> Q. Why do i confuse between 2 pointers and sliding window?


That's a **very common confusion** — and you're not alone.

Let’s break down **why** you're mixing up **Two Pointers** and **Sliding Window**, and how to **clearly separate** them in your mind:

---

## 🤯 Why the Confusion Happens

Because **sliding window is built using two pointers**, but **not all two pointer problems are sliding windows**.

| Concept        | Overlaps                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Two Pointers   | More general tool (left/right, slow/fast)            |
| Sliding Window | A specific use case: contiguous subarrays/substrings |

---

## ✅ Clear Distinction

| Feature             | **Two Pointers**                         | **Sliding Window**                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose             | Compare/move from two ends, match values | Maintain a window over contiguous elements |
| Must be contiguous? | ❌ No                                     | ✅ Yes (always contiguous)                  |
| Window Size         | Not always fixed/dynamic                 | Fixed or dynamic size window               |
| Common Goal         | Pairs, reverse, find mid, merge          | Sum, length, count, frequency in window    |
| Key Structure       | Often two independent pointers           | One pointer grows, one shrinks the window  |

---

## 🔁 Example Comparison

### 🔹 Two Pointers: Find pair with sum

```js
// Sorted array
let left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
  if (nums[left] + nums[right] === target) return true;
  else if (...) left++; else right--;
}
```

### 🔸 Sliding Window: Longest substring with k distinct chars

```js
let start = 0, freq = new Map();
for (let end = 0; end < s.length; end++) {
  freq.set(...);
  while (freq.size > k) {
    freq.delete(...);
    start++;
  }
  maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, end - start + 1);
}
```

---

## 🧠 Mental Model

* **If the range must be continuous**, and you’re **tracking something inside the window**, it’s **sliding window**.
* **==If you're working with sorted arrays==**, matching from ends, or **no need for continuity**, it’s usually **plain two pointers**.

---

## ✅ Tip to Remember

> **All sliding window problems use two pointers,
> but not all two pointer problems are sliding windows.**

---

Here's a **1-line decision rule** and a simple **flowchart-style checklist** to help you instantly decide:



## ✅ **One-Line Rule**

> 🔍 **If you're moving across a **contiguous** range and tracking things like sum, length, or count — it's Sliding Window.**
> Otherwise, it's likely just a Two Pointer pattern.

---

## 🧭 **Flowchart-Style Checklist**

```text
1. Is the question about subarray/substring or a continuous range?
   → Yes → Go Sliding Window

2. Are you tracking max/min/sum/count/length in a range?
   → Yes → Go Sliding Window

3. Is the array sorted and you're finding pairs (e.g., target sum)?
   → Yes → Two Pointers (Opposite ends)

4. Are you scanning for matching elements or removing duplicates?
   → Yes → Two Pointers (Fast & Slow)

5. Is the data not required to be continuous?
   → Yes → Two Pointers
```

## 🎯 Quick Pattern Matches

| Keyword in Question            | Pattern        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| "subarray", "substring"        | Sliding Window |
| "longest", "shortest" in range | Sliding Window |
| "remove duplicates"            | Two Pointers   |
| "sorted array" + "pair"        | Two Pointers   |
| "in-place" modification        | Two Pointers   |

---

### 💬 Example to Practice:

* **"Find the longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters"** → ✅ Sliding Window
* **"Find if a pair sums to target in sorted array"** → ✅ Two Pointers
* **"Remove duplicates in-place from sorted array"** → ✅ Two Pointers
* **"Max sum of subarray of size K"** → ✅ Sliding Window
