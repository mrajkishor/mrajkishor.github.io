# 📘 Computer Networks: Definition, Goals, and Applications

## **1.1 What are Computer Networks?**

A **computer network** is a system of interconnected computing devices like computers, servers, routers, switches, and other hardware that are connected to **facilitate communication**, **data exchange**, and **resource sharing**.

These connections can be:

* **Wired** (e.g., Ethernet, fiber optic)
* **Wireless** (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)

### ✨ Key Features:

* **Data Exchange**: Devices can send and receive data efficiently.
* **Resource Sharing**: Devices like printers, databases, or file servers can be shared.
* **Communication Tools**: Email, chat, and video conferencing run over networks.
* **Scalability**: Easily extendable to support new devices or locations.

### 🧱 Types of Connections:

* **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Small-scale, like home/office
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Large-scale, like the Internet
