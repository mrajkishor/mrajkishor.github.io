## 🧠 What is React Fiber?

**React Fiber** is the **reconciliation engine** behind React — the part of React responsible for:

* Figuring out what to render
* How to update the DOM
* When and how to pause, resume, or cancel work

> 📌 In simple terms: **Fiber is the algorithm that enables React to render efficiently and asynchronously.**

## 📜 Why Was Fiber Introduced?

Before React v16 (pre-2017), React used a **stack-based recursive algorithm**. It worked fine for small updates, but had major **limitations**:

| Old React (Stack) Limitations | Description                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ❌ No interruption             | Long renders could block the main thread |
| ❌ No prioritization           | All updates were treated equally         |
| ❌ Poor error handling         | Couldn’t gracefully recover mid-render   |
| ❌ No concurrency              | Couldn’t split work across frames        |

👉 React Fiber was built to **solve these issues**, enabling **incremental rendering**, **concurrent mode**, and **smoother UX**.

## 🚧 What is a "Fiber"?

A **fiber** is a JavaScript object that represents a **unit of work** for the React engine.

Think of it like a **virtual thread** — each fiber node corresponds to one React element (`<div>`, `<MyComponent>`, etc.) and tracks:

* What type it is (function/class/host/etc.)
* What it should render
* What it rendered last time
* What needs to change

### 🔹 A Fiber Node has:

```ts
{
  type,            // The component or DOM tag (e.g., 'div')
  key,             // Used for list reconciliation
  stateNode,       // DOM node or class instance
  child,           // First child fiber
  sibling,         // Next sibling fiber
  return,          // Parent fiber
  alternate,       // Previous version of this fiber (used for diffing)
  effectTag,       // What needs to be done (update, delete, etc.)
}
```

## ⚙️ How Fiber Works (Under the Hood)

Fiber introduces a **two-phase architecture**:

### 🔹 1. **Render Phase (Reconciliation)**

* Build the fiber tree by comparing new elements with the old tree
* Work is split into **units**, so it can be **paused, resumed, or aborted**
* It’s **pure** — no side effects

> ⏸️ Can be **interrupted** for higher-priority tasks (e.g. user input)

### 🔹 2. **Commit Phase**

* Apply the actual changes to the DOM
* Run lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `useEffect`, etc.)

> 🔥 This phase is **not interruptible**

## 🧩 Features Unlocked by Fiber

| Feature                   | Enabled by Fiber |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| ✅ Interruptible rendering | Yes              |
| ✅ Prioritized updates     | Yes              |
| ✅ Better error handling   | Yes              |
| ✅ Concurrent rendering    | Yes (v18+)       |
| ✅ Suspense / Lazy loading | Yes              |
| ✅ Time-slicing            | Yes              |

---

## ⚡ Example: Why Interruptible Rendering Matters

Imagine a component rendering a huge list:

```tsx
<BigList items={100000} />
```

In the old architecture, React would **block the main thread** until it finishes rendering the entire tree. This freezes the UI.

With Fiber + Concurrent Mode, React can:

* Pause rendering mid-way
* Handle user input like a button click
* Resume rendering later

🎯 Result: **Much smoother user experience**

## 🧠 Visualizing Fiber as a Work Loop

Fiber transforms rendering into a **work loop**:

```tsx
while (nextUnitOfWork) {
  nextUnitOfWork = performUnitOfWork(nextUnitOfWork);
}
```

> This lets React yield control back to the browser if needed — similar to how schedulers or operating systems work.

---

## 🧪 How Fiber Enables Concurrent React (React 18+)

Fiber alone doesn't mean concurrent rendering is on — it **enables** it, but it's turned on via:

```tsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
root.render(<App />);
```

This uses the **Concurrent Renderer**, unlocking:

* `useTransition()`
* `Suspense` for data fetching
* `startTransition()` for deferring updates

---

## ⚠️ Fiber Is an Internal Implementation Detail

You usually **don’t interact with Fiber directly** — but understanding it helps explain:

* Why some renders are fast
* Why updates seem “batched”
* Why some `useEffect` behaviors are delayed

## 🧠 Summary

| Key Concept       | Description                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fiber             | React’s internal architecture for rendering             |
| Unit of Work      | Small tasks React processes in chunks                   |
| Render vs Commit  | First phase builds virtual changes, second applies them |
| Concurrency Ready | Fiber enables smoother async rendering                  |
| Replaces Stack    | Old recursive algorithm was blocking and rigid          |
