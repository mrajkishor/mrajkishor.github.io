The LeetCode problem **[134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)** is a **greedy algorithm** problem that requires finding the starting gas station index from which a car can complete a full circular tour. Here's a breakdown:

### **Problem Statement**
- You have **n** gas stations arranged in a circular route.
- You have two integer arrays:
  - `gas[i]`: Amount of gas at station `i`.
  - `cost[i]`: Amount of gas needed to travel from station `i` to station `i+1`.
- You need to determine if you can travel around the circuit once in a clockwise direction, starting from a particular gas station.
- If possible, return the index of the starting station; otherwise, return `-1`.

### **Key Observations**
1. If the **total gas available** is **less than the total cost required**, it's **impossible** to complete the circuit.
   \[
   \sum gas[i] < \sum cost[i] \Rightarrow \text{Return } -1
   \]
2. If the total gas is sufficient, there exists a valid starting station.
3. The greedy approach ensures that if we run out of gas at a certain station, then **all previous stations in that journey are invalid starting points**.

### **Optimal Greedy Approach**
1. Compute `totalGas = sum(gas)`, `totalCost = sum(cost)`.
   - If `totalGas < totalCost`, return `-1`.
2. Iterate through the stations while maintaining:
   - `tank`: Tracks available gas.
   - `startIndex`: Candidate starting station.
   - If `tank` becomes negative at any station, reset `tank` to 0 and update `startIndex` to the next station.
3. Return `startIndex`.

### **Time Complexity**
- **O(n)** since we iterate through the stations only once.

### **Java Code**
```java
public class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int totalGas = 0, totalCost = 0;
        int tank = 0, startIndex = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];

            if (tank < 0) { // Reset if we run out of gas
                startIndex = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return totalGas < totalCost ? -1 : startIndex;
    }
}
```

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Input**
```plaintext
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
```
#### **Calculations**
1. `totalGas = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15`
2. `totalCost = 3+4+5+1+2 = 15` (Since `totalGas >= totalCost`, a solution exists)
3. Start from index `0`, track the remaining gas.
   - At index `0`, `tank = 1-3 = -2` → Reset `startIndex = 1`
   - At index `1`, `tank = 2-4 = -2` → Reset `startIndex = 2`
   - At index `2`, `tank = 3-5 = -2` → Reset `startIndex = 3`
   - At index `3`, `tank = 4-1 = 3` (Valid)
   - At index `4`, `tank = 3 + (5-2) = 6` (Valid)
4. The answer is `startIndex = 3`.

### **Summary**
- If `totalGas < totalCost`, return `-1`.
- If `tank` becomes negative, the previous stations are invalid, reset `startIndex`.
- Return the valid `startIndex`.
