---

## **1.1 What is an Operating System?**

An **Operating System (OS)** is a **program that manages computer hardware** and provides an environment for application programs to run. It acts as a **bridge** between the user and hardware.

* **Core role:** Resource manager and control program.
* **Always running part:** **Kernel** (permanently in memory).
* Other components: System programs (utilities, compilers) and application programs.

**Analogy:** Like a government — it doesn’t do useful work itself, but provides the rules and framework for others to operate efficiently.

### **Components of a Computer System**

1. **Hardware** – CPU, memory, I/O devices.
2. **Operating System** – Controls hardware, manages resources.
3. **Application Programs** – Compilers, browsers, games, etc.
4. **Users** – Humans, other systems, or programs.

## **1.2 Views of an OS**

### **User View**

* **PC/Desktop:** Focus on ease of use and responsiveness.
* **Mainframe:** Multiple users, resource sharing → efficiency is priority.
* **Workstation in network:** Balance between usability and sharing.
* **Mobile devices:** Touch-based UI, app ecosystem, wireless connectivity.
* **Embedded systems:** Minimal/no direct user interface, purpose-built.

### **System View**

* **Resource Allocator:** Manages CPU time, memory, I/O devices, storage.
* **Control Program:** Prevents misuse, manages execution of processes.

## **1.3 Defining an OS**

No universal definition.
Common definition for exam purposes:

> *“An OS is the one program running at all times on the computer (the kernel), plus associated system programs that provide a usable environment for applications.”*

## **1.4 Computer-System Organization**

A modern computer typically has:

* **One or more CPUs**
* **Device controllers** for I/O devices
* **Shared memory** connected via a system bus

### **Boot Process**

1. **Bootstrap program** in ROM/firmware initializes system.
2. Loads kernel into memory.
3. Starts system processes (e.g., `init` in UNIX/Linux).

---

### **Interrupts**

* **Hardware interrupt:** From device (e.g., I/O completion).
* **Software interrupt:** From system call.
* **Interrupt vector:** Table mapping device numbers → service routines.
* **Direct Memory Access (DMA):** Transfers blocks between device and memory without CPU intervention.

## **1.5 Storage Structure**

### **Memory Types (by speed & volatility)**

1. **Registers** (fastest, volatile)
2. **Cache**
3. **Main memory (RAM)**
4. **Solid-state drives (SSD)**
5. **Magnetic disks**
6. **Optical disks**
7. **Magnetic tapes** (slowest, non-volatile)

**Volatile:** Loses data on power-off (e.g., RAM).
**Non-volatile:** Retains data without power.

**Storage hierarchy:** Faster = smaller & costlier; slower = larger & cheaper.

---

## **1.6 I/O Structure**

* **Device controller:** Manages a specific device.
* **Device driver:** Software interface for OS to communicate with controller.
* **Interrupt-driven I/O:** CPU executes other work while waiting.
* **DMA:** Efficient bulk transfer without CPU for every byte.

---

## **1.7 Computer-System Architecture**

### **Single-Processor Systems**

* One general-purpose CPU.
* May have special-purpose processors (e.g., keyboard controller).

### **Multiprocessor Systems**

* **Advantages:**

  1. Increased throughput
  2. Economy of scale
  3. Higher reliability (graceful degradation)
* **Types:**

  * **Asymmetric:** One boss CPU assigns work.
  * **Symmetric (SMP):** All CPUs are peers (most modern OSs use SMP).

### **Multicore Systems**

* Multiple CPU cores on a single chip.
* Faster on-chip communication, less power.

### **Clustered Systems**

* Multiple independent systems connected (high-availability, load balancing).

---

## **1.8 OS Operations**

OS is **event-driven**:

* **Startup**: Load OS.
* **Wait for events**: Interrupts from hardware or software.
* **Process event**: Run handler, resume.

**Dual mode operation**:

* **User mode** – Restricted, cannot directly access hardware.
* **Kernel mode** – Full hardware access.
* **Mode bit** distinguishes them.

---

## **1.9 Resource Management Responsibilities**

1. **Process Management** – Creation, scheduling, termination.
2. **Main Memory Management** – Allocation & protection.
3. **File-System Management** – Store, retrieve, organize data.
4. **I/O Management** – Device communication.
5. **Secondary-Storage Management** – Space allocation, scheduling.
6. **Networking** – Communication over networks.
7. **Protection & Security** – Authentication, access control.

## **1.10 Computing Environments**

### **Traditional**

* Standalone, general-purpose systems.
* Variety of I/O devices.

### **Client-Server**

* Clients request services from centralized servers.

### **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**

* Each node acts as both client and server.

### **Virtualization**

* Multiple OSs run on a single physical machine.

### **Cloud Computing**

* Infrastructure (IaaS), platforms (PaaS), and software (SaaS) delivered over the internet.

### **Real-time Systems**

* Hard vs. Soft deadlines.

## **1.11 Open-Source OS Examples**

* **Linux** – UNIX-like, open-source kernel.
* **BSD UNIX**
* **Android** (Linux-based)
* **iOS**

## **GATE Exam Pointers**

* Know **role differences**: User view vs System view.
* Be clear on **kernel vs system programs**.
* Understand **interrupt handling** and **DMA**.
* Storage hierarchy ordering is often asked.
* Multiprocessing types & benefits are a favorite question area.
* Dual mode operation & system calls are frequent MCQs.
