### 🛠️ Microfrontend Frameworks and Tools – **Lerna**

---

> Note: Lerna is not a microfrontend framework but a monorepo management tool that helps organize and version MFEs and shared packages efficiently in large codebases.


### 🛠️ What is Lerna?

**Lerna** is an open-source **monorepo management tool** for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It helps developers organize, manage, and maintain **multiple related packages** within a **single repository**, simplifying workflows like dependency linking, versioning, and publishing.

> 📌 Originally built to manage large-scale projects like Babel and React, Lerna is now widely used to streamline development across any multi-package project.

### 🎯 Key Features

| Feature                         | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📦 **Package Management**       | Manages multiple npm packages within one monorepo                   |
| 🔁 **Local Dependency Linking** | Automatically links packages to each other during development       |
| 🔢 **Versioning Strategies**    | Supports both fixed and independent versioning across packages      |
| 🚀 **Automated Publishing**     | Publishes changed packages with changelogs and tags                 |
| ⚙️ **Scoped Command Execution** | Run scripts across all or selected packages (`build`, `test`, etc.) |

### 🧱 Folder Structure Example

```bash
my-lerna-project/
├── packages/
│   ├── package-a/
│   ├── package-b/
│   └── shared-lib/
├── lerna.json
├── package.json
```

Each subfolder in `packages/` is treated as a standalone npm package with its own `package.json`.

---

### 🛠️ Sample `lerna.json`

```json
{
  "packages": ["packages/*"],
  "version": "independent",
  "npmClient": "npm",
  "useWorkspaces": true
}
```

This config tells Lerna to manage all folders under `packages/` and allows independent versioning.

---

### ✅ When to Use Lerna

Use Lerna when:

* You’re building or maintaining **multiple npm packages** in one repository.
* You want to **share code** between those packages without publishing to npm.
* You need **fine-grained version control** and release management.
* You want to automate publishing workflows.
