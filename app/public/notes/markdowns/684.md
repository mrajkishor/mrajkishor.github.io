### üß© Microfrontend Design Approaches ‚Äì **Vertical Split**

---

#### üîπ What is Vertical Split?

The **Vertical Split** approach divides the application based on **features, domains, or business functionalities**, where **each microfrontend owns the entire vertical slice** ‚Äî including **UI, logic, and possibly its own backend (via BFF)**.

It aligns closely with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, where each MFE is responsible for a **self-contained feature or domain**.

---

#### üß± Example Use Case:

In a banking app:

* The **Account Summary** page is one MFE.
* The **Transactions** section is another MFE.
* The **Profile Settings** is handled by a third MFE.

Each of these features can have their own UI, routing, state management, and API integration ‚Äî fully **independent**.

---

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:

1. **Feature Independence**
   Teams can build, deploy, and scale independent features without coordination bottlenecks.

2. **Domain Ownership**
   Maps well to agile teams that own specific business domains (like payments, orders, profiles).

3. **Scalable Architecture**
   Works well for large enterprise apps with multiple product modules or lines.

4. **Easier Testing & CI/CD**
   Since each vertical slice is self-contained, testing and deployment can be modular.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:

1. **Routing Complexity**
   Managing nested routes across MFEs (especially in SPAs) requires coordination or shared router mechanisms.

2. **Shared Component Duplication**
   Without a shared design system, similar UI components may be reimplemented across MFEs.

3. **Cross-MFE Communication**
   Data sharing between domains (e.g., user ID in Orders and Profile) requires event bus or shared state patterns.

---

#### üõ† Best Practices:

* Use **Module Federation** with **dynamic remotes** for decoupled loading.
* Implement a **shared design system** or UI component library.
* Use a **global state manager** (Redux, Zustand) or **event bus** for cross-MFE communication.
* Consider a **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** per MFE to decouple backend integration.

---

#### üìå When to Use Vertical Split?

* When teams are organized around **business capabilities**.
* When your app needs **modular scaling** and **independent deployment**.
* When you're building a **multi-product or multi-team app**, such as an enterprise dashboard or e-commerce platform.
