## Best, Average, Worst Case Analysis

## 🔍 What is Case-wise Analysis?

When analyzing an algorithm’s performance, **not all inputs behave the same**. Some may finish quickly, while others take longer. Hence, we analyze an algorithm’s behavior in **three different scenarios**:

| Case Type    | Meaning                      | GATE Importance |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| Best Case    | Fastest possible execution   | ⭐ Sometimes     |
| Average Case | Expected/typical performance | ⭐⭐ Moderate     |
| Worst Case   | Slowest possible execution   | ⭐⭐⭐ Very High   |

These are used to give a more complete picture of how efficient an algorithm is across various inputs.

## 1️⃣ **Best Case Analysis**

### ✅ Definition:

It refers to the **minimum amount of time or operations** required by an algorithm on the most favorable input.

### 📌 Characteristics:

* Often **not useful in isolation** unless you're guaranteed ideal input.
* Represented using **Ω (Omega) Notation**.

### 🧪 Example:

```python
# Linear search - best case
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == key:
        return i
```

If `key` is at index 0:

* Best Case Time = Ω(1)

## 2️⃣ **Average Case Analysis**

### ✅ Definition:

It refers to the **expected time complexity** over **all possible inputs**, usually assuming some **probabilistic distribution**.

### 📌 Characteristics:

* More realistic than best or worst case.
* Requires **mathematical modeling** or assumptions about input distribution.
* Represented using **Θ (Theta) Notation**.

### 🧪 Example:

For linear search:

* If the key is equally likely to be at any position,
* Average case time:
  `T(n) = (1 + 2 + 3 + … + n)/n = (n+1)/2 = Θ(n)`

---

## 3️⃣ **Worst Case Analysis**

### ✅ Definition:

It refers to the **maximum time** taken on any input of size `n`. This gives an upper bound on algorithm complexity.

### 📌 Characteristics:

* Most widely used in GATE and interviews.
* Critical in **real-time or safety-critical systems**.
* Represented using **O (Big-O) Notation**.

### 🧪 Example:

```python
# Binary Search
low = 0
high = n - 1
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if arr[mid] == key:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] < key:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1
```

* Worst Case: key not present → O(log n)

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Algorithm     | Best Case  | Average Case | Worst Case |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Linear Search | O(1)       | Θ(n)         | O(n)       |
| Binary Search | O(1)       | Θ(log n)     | O(log n)   |
| Bubble Sort   | O(n)       | Θ(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| QuickSort     | O(n log n) | Θ(n log n)   | O(n²)      |
| MergeSort     | O(n log n) | Θ(n log n)   | O(n log n) |

## 💡 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine searching for a book in a library:

* **Best Case**: The book is on the first shelf (Ω(1))
* **Average Case**: It’s somewhere in the middle (Θ(n/2))
* **Worst Case**: It's the last book, or not there at all (O(n))

---

## 🧠 Tips for GATE

* **Worst-case dominates in GATE** questions.
* **Average-case is asked for** QuickSort, Hashing, Linear Search.
* Use **mathematical expectation** when analyzing average case.
* Don’t confuse best/worst **input** with best/worst **complexity** — they are **output of analysis**, not input conditions.

## 🔁 Related Asymptotic Bounds

| Case Type | Notation | Meaning     |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Best      | Ω(f(n))  | Lower Bound |
| Average   | Θ(f(n))  | Tight Bound |
| Worst     | O(f(n))  | Upper Bound |

## 📘 Summary

* **Best Case** → Ideal situation, rarely relied upon.
* **Average Case** → Most realistic but harder to compute.
* **Worst Case** → Guarantees, upper bound — **most important for GATE**.
