> Q: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/


My approach: 

```ts

function check(nums: number[]): boolean {

    let count = 0; 
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i+1]) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    //circular check
    if (nums[nums.length - 1] > nums[0]){
        count++;
    }
    
    if (count > 1) {
        return false;
    }

    return true
};

```



### Explanation of this problem: 



### 💡 What’s the question asking?

You are given an array like this:

```js
[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

And the question is:
“Was this array originally **sorted**, and then **rotated**?”

---

### 🤔 What does “sorted and rotated” mean?

First, imagine this sorted array:

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]   ✅ (sorted in increasing order)
```

Now rotate (cut from somewhere and move front to back):

* Rotate at index 0 → `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` ✅
* Rotate at index 1 → `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]` ✅
* Rotate at index 2 → `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` ✅
* Rotate at index 3 → `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]` ✅

👉 All are **valid** because they came from the original sorted array.

---

### 🔍 So what do we check?

Go through the array and check:

> How many times does the array go **down** (i.e., `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`)?

If it goes down **more than once**, it’s not a rotated sorted array.

Because in a rotated sorted array, there’s only **one place** where the big number (end) is followed by a small number (start).

---

### ✅ Example 1:

```
Input: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

Go through and compare each number with the next:

* 3 < 4 ✅
* 4 < 5 ✅
* 5 > 1 ❌ (drops here)
* 1 < 2 ✅
* 2 < 3 ✅ (circular check)

👉 Only **one drop** → ✅ This is sorted and rotated
✅ Answer: `true`

---

### ❌ Example 2:

```
Input: [2, 1, 3, 4]
```

* 2 > 1 ❌ (drops here)
* 1 < 3 ✅
* 3 < 4 ✅
* 4 < 2 ❌ (circular check)

👉 Two drops ❌
❌ Answer: `false`

---

### ✅ Example 3:

```
Input: [1, 2, 3]
```

* 1 < 2 ✅
* 2 < 3 ✅
* 3 < 1 ❌ (circular check)

👉 Only one drop → ✅ Valid
✅ Answer: `true`

---

### ✅ Trick to Remember

✅ **Only one drop allowed** → `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`
❌ More than one → not sorted + rotated


---

==P.S.==

 **This approach is much better than sorting**, because it runs in **O(n)** time, while sorting takes **O(n log n)**.

---

### 🔍 Let’s compare:

| Approach                             | Time Complexity | Why                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Count drops (the one we explained) | **O(n)**        | Just loop once through the array       |
| ❌ Sort and compare                   | **O(n log n)**  | Sorting takes longer as array gets big |

---

### 🤔 Why not just sort?

You *could* sort the array and then check if rotating it gives the original, but:

* Sorting is **slower**.
* It's **unnecessary** — the “drop count” trick gives the same answer **faster**.

---

### ✅ Final Verdict

The "count how many times `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`" approach is **faster and better** than sorting.
It works in a **single pass**, so it's perfect for interview coding questions.
