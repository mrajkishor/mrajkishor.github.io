### üßπ What is Tree Shaking (and Why Should I Care)?

Tree shaking is basically a fancy name for **removing dead code** ‚Äî the stuff you imported but never actually used.

Imagine your codebase is a big tree.
Tree shaking goes in, looks for the **unused branches**, and trims them off before shipping your app to users.

It keeps your **bundle size smaller**, your **app faster**, and your **load time snappier**.

---

### üß† How It Actually Works

Tree shaking is possible because of **ES6 module syntax** (`import` / `export`) ‚Äî it‚Äôs static and predictable.
Webpack can analyze what‚Äôs actually being used at build time.

Let‚Äôs say you have a utility file like this:

```js
// utils.js
export function add() { ... }
export function subtract() { ... }
export function multiply() { ... }
```

And in your app you only use `add`:

```js
import { add } from './utils';
```

If tree shaking is working correctly, Webpack will **only include the `add` function** in your bundle. The rest gets left behind like unused luggage.

### ‚úÖ What You Need to Enable Tree Shaking

1. **Use ES Modules (not CommonJS)**
   Tree shaking doesn't work well with `require()` and `module.exports`.

2. **Set `mode: 'production'`** in Webpack
   Production mode enables optimizations like minification and dead-code elimination.

3. **Avoid Side Effects**
   If a file does something globally (like modifying the DOM), Webpack assumes it‚Äôs needed.
   You can help Webpack by marking safe files as `"sideEffects": false` in `package.json`.

```json
{
  "sideEffects": false
}
```

Or be specific:

```json
{
  "sideEffects": ["./styles/global.css"]
}
```

### üîç Gotchas (Things That Might Break Tree Shaking)

* Using `require()` instead of `import`
* Importing entire libraries (like `import _ from 'lodash'`) instead of just what you need (`import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep'`)
* Forgetting to use production mode

---

### üß™ How to Check If It‚Äôs Working

Use tools like:

* `webpack-bundle-analyzer`
* `source-map-explorer`

They show you which code is in your final bundle. If `subtract()` is showing up when you didn‚Äôt use it ‚Äî something‚Äôs wrong.

---

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Real Example

**Before Tree Shaking:**

* Your `utils.js` adds 10 KB to the bundle

**After Tree Shaking:**

* Only 3 KB (just the `add` function you actually used)

Multiply this over hundreds of components and libraries ‚Äî and you start seeing **real performance gains**.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept      | Meaning                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Tree Shaking | Removing unused exports from your bundles |
| Requirements | ES Modules, Prod Mode, No Side Effects    |
| Benefit      | Smaller, faster bundles                   |

Tree shaking is one of those behind-the-scenes Webpack features that just silently makes your app feel faster ‚Äî **if you set things up right**.
