## 📘 Minimisation Techniques in Boolean Algebra

**Minimisation techniques** are methods used to reduce Boolean expressions to their simplest form, which in turn helps in designing efficient and cost-effective logic circuits. The primary goals of minimisation are:

* 🔹 Reduce the **number of terms**
* 🔹 Reduce the **number of literals** (variables) in those terms

These techniques are crucial in digital logic design to **optimize circuit size, speed, and power consumption**.

### 🔧 Main Minimisation Techniques

#### 1. **Algebraic Minimisation**

Uses Boolean algebra rules (like De Morgan’s, absorption, distribution) to simplify expressions manually. It's helpful but **not systematic** for large functions.

#### 2. **Karnaugh Map (K-map) Method**

A visual, tabular method ideal for up to **4 or 5 variables**. It groups 1s (for SOP) or 0s (for POS) to eliminate unnecessary terms.

#### 3. **Quine-McCluskey Method**

Also known as the **tabulation method**, it is a **systematic** and **algorithmic** technique used for simplifying functions with **more than 4 variables**. It is computer-friendly and ideal for software-based simplification.

## 🔸 SOP (Sum of Products) Minimisation using K-map

SOP form: Output = sum of product terms (like `A'B + AB'`)

### 📝 Steps:

1. **Select K-map size** based on number of variables (2, 3, 4…).
2. **Mark 1s** in K-map corresponding to the **minterms** (where output = 1).
3. **Group adjacent 1s** into:

   * Pairs (2 cells)
   * Quads (4 cells)
   * Octets (8 cells)
4. Groups must be in **powers of 2** and as large as possible.
5. **Wrap around** the edges if needed (K-map is cyclic).
6. **Write simplified terms** for each group (omit changing variables).
7. **Combine terms** to get final simplified SOP expression.

#### ✅ Example:

If 1s are at minterms 0, 1, 2, 3
→ Group into quad → Simplified SOP = A'

## 🔸 POS (Product of Sums) Minimisation using K-map

POS form: Output = product of sum terms (like `(A + B)(A' + C)`)

### 📝 Steps:

1. **Select K-map size** based on number of variables.
2. **Mark 0s** for the **Maxterms** (where output = 0).
3. **Group adjacent 0s** (Pairs, Quads, Octets), largest possible.
4. **Circle as many large groups as possible** for maximum simplification.
5. Each group gives a simplified **sum term**.
6. Combine all sum terms into a **final POS expression**.

#### ✅ Example:

If 0s are at maxterms 4, 5
→ Pair them → Simplified POS = (A + B')

### 🔁 Tips for Grouping (both SOP & POS)

| Type        | Group Size | Description                             |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Pair        | 2 cells    | Adjacent cells horizontally/vertically  |
| Quad        | 4 cells    | Block of 2×2 or line of 4               |
| Octet       | 8 cells    | Line or block covering 8 adjacent cells |
| Wrap-around | Yes        | Edges of the map connect                |

## 🧠 Why Minimisation is Important

* 🔹 **Reduces hardware cost** (fewer gates)
* 🔹 **Improves speed** (fewer gate delays)
* 🔹 **Eases implementation** on ICs and FPGAs
* 🔹 **Improves reliability** with fewer components
