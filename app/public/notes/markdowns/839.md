# âœ… **Programming Arithmetic and Logic Operations**

In every programming language, arithmetic and logical operations play a crucial role in processing data, decision-making, and flow control. These operations are foundational for building algorithms, solving problems, and interacting with system resources.

## ðŸ”¢ **Arithmetic Operators**

Arithmetic operators are symbols used to perform mathematical operations on numeric data. These include basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding remainders.

### ðŸ“˜ Operator Table

| Operator | Description                             | Example | Meaning                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| `+`      | Adds two operands                       | `A + B` | Add A and B              |
| `-`      | Subtracts second operand from the first | `A - B` | Subtract B from A        |
| `*`      | Multiplies two operands                 | `A * B` | Multiply A by B          |
| `/`      | Divides numerator by denominator        | `B / A` | Divide B by A            |
| `%`      | Remainder of integer division           | `B % A` | Remainder of B divided A |

### ðŸ§ª Example in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x, y, z;

    x = 20;
    y = 10;

    z = x + y;
    printf("Value of z = %d\n", z);

    z = x - y;
    printf("Value of z = %d\n", z);

    z = x * y;
    printf("Value of z = %d\n", z);

    z = x / y;
    printf("Value of z = %d\n", z);

    z = x % y;
    printf("Value of z = %d\n", z);

    return 0;
}
```

### ðŸ§¾ Output:

```
Value of z = 30
Value of z = 10
Value of z = 200
Value of z = 2
Value of z = 0
```

## ðŸ¤– **Logical Operators**

Logical operators allow conditional control flow in programs by evaluating expressions as **true (non-zero)** or **false (zero)**. They're essential in `if`, `while`, and other control statements.

### ðŸ“˜ Logical Operator Table

| Operator | Description                                                | Example     | Result (if A = 1, B = 0)                             |      |   |      |        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---- | - | ---- | ------ |
| `&&`     | **Logical AND**: true if both operands are true            | `(A && B)`  | `false`                                              |      |   |      |        |
| \`       |                                                            | \`          | **Logical OR**: true if at least one operand is true | \`(A |   | B)\` | `true` |
| `!`      | **Logical NOT**: reverses the logical state of its operand | `!(A && B)` | `true`                                               |      |   |      |        |

### ðŸ§ª Example in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 1;
    int y = 0;

    if (x && y) {
        printf("It would never print as condition is false\n");
    }

    if (x || y) {
        printf("It will print as condition is true\n");
    }

    if (!(x && y)) {
        printf("It will print as condition is true\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### ðŸ§¾ Output:

```
It will print as condition is true
It will print as condition is true
```

## âœ… Summary

* **Arithmetic operators** perform mathematical computations on numeric data.
* **Logical operators** evaluate the truthfulness of expressions and are vital in control flow.
* These operators are **language-independent**, meaning they exist in all major languages like C, Java, Python, JavaScript etc.
* Mastering them is key to writing effective and efficient programs.
