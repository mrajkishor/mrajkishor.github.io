### 📘 The Relational Model – A Core of Database Systems

---

### 🔹 What is the Relational Model?

The **Relational Model**, proposed by **E. F. Codd in 1970**, is the foundation of modern relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. It represents data as **relations** (which you can think of as tables), and uses **mathematical concepts** from set theory and predicate logic to define and manipulate data.

It is both:

* **Conceptual** (used for database design), and
* **Practical** (used in real database systems)

---

### 🔹 Core Concepts of the Relational Model

---

#### 🟩 1. **Relation (Table)**

* A **relation** is a **two-dimensional table** consisting of:

  * **Rows (tuples)**: Each row represents a unique record.
  * **Columns (attributes)**: Each column holds a specific attribute of the data.

✅ **Example**:

```plaintext
Student Table:
+-----------+--------+-----------+
| StudentID | Name   | Age       |
+-----------+--------+-----------+
| 101       | Raj    | 21        |
| 102       | Priya  | 20        |
+-----------+--------+-----------+
```

---

#### 🟨 2. **Attribute**

* Represents the **name of a column** in a relation.
* Each attribute has a **domain** — a set of allowed values.

> For instance, the attribute `Age` might only accept integer values from 1 to 120.

---

#### 🟥 3. **Tuple**

* Each **row in a relation** is a **tuple**.
* It is an **ordered set** of attribute values.

> A tuple in the Student table: `(101, Raj, 21)`

---

#### 🟦 4. **Schema and Instance**

* **Schema**: The structure of a relation — its name, attributes, and their types.

  * Example: `Student(StudentID: int, Name: varchar, Age: int)`
* **Instance**: The actual content (rows) stored in the table at a specific time.

---

#### 🟧 5. **Keys in the Relational Model**

* **Super Key**: A set of one or more attributes that uniquely identify a tuple.
* **Candidate Key**: A minimal super key (no extra attributes).
* **Primary Key**: A chosen candidate key used to uniquely identify tuples. Must be:

  * Unique
  * Not null
* **Foreign Key**: An attribute in one relation that refers to the **primary key of another relation**.

> 📌 Foreign keys **create relationships** between tables.

---

#### 🟫 6. **Integrity Constraints**

* **Domain Constraint**: Each attribute must take values from a defined domain.
* **Entity Integrity**: Primary key cannot have NULL values.
* **Referential Integrity**: A foreign key value must match a primary key value in the referenced relation, or be NULL.

---

### 🔷 Example: University Database

Let’s say we have two relations:

**Student(StudentID, Name, Age)**
**Enrollment(StudentID, CourseID, Grade)**

* `StudentID` is a **primary key** in the `Student` table.
* In `Enrollment`, `StudentID` is a **foreign key** referencing the `Student` table.

This is a **one-to-many relationship**: One student can enroll in many courses.

### ✅ Properties of a Relation

| Property                 | Description                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| No duplicate tuples      | Each row is unique                  |
| Tuples are unordered     | Order of rows doesn’t matter        |
| Attributes are unordered | Column order doesn’t affect data    |
| Atomic attributes        | Values in each cell are indivisible |

> 💡 These properties align with **First Normal Form (1NF)**.

### 🔧 Relational Operations (Brief Preview)

Operations such as **select**, **project**, **join**, **union**, and **difference** are defined in **relational algebra**, which operates on these relations. These are **purely mathematical** and form the theoretical foundation for **SQL queries**.

---

### 🧠 GATE Tips

* 💡 Know the difference between **super key**, **candidate key**, and **primary key** — GATE loves to test this in tricky ways.
* 💡 Understand how **foreign keys enforce referential integrity** and what happens when you delete/update referenced data.
* 💡 Focus on **constraint violations** — especially in multiple-choice conceptual questions.
