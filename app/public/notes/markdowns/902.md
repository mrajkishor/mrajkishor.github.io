## 🧭 React Routing Basics (Using React Router)

Routing in React means controlling which component shows up when a user navigates to a particular **URL** in a **Single Page Application (SPA)**. Unlike traditional websites, React doesn't reload the page — instead, it dynamically renders components based on the current route.

To implement this behavior, we commonly use **React Router** — a powerful routing library specifically built for React apps.

### 📦 What is React Router?

**React Router** is a third-party package that allows you to:

* Map different URL paths to different components
* Navigate between views without refreshing the browser
* Pass route parameters, redirect users, protect routes, and more

---

### 🔧 Installing React Router

If you're using React 18 or above, you can install the latest version:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

---

### 🛠️ Basic Setup for Routing

Here’s the bare minimum to get routing up and running:

#### 1. Wrap your App in a Router

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

#### 2. Define Routes Inside Your App

```tsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import About from "./pages/About";

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

✅ Now when users visit `/`, they see the Home component. When they go to `/about`, they see the About page — **without page reloads**.

### 🧭 Core Concepts

#### 🧩 `<BrowserRouter>`

* Enables HTML5 history API (clean URLs)
* Should be placed at the top level of your app (usually in `index.tsx` or `main.jsx`)

#### 🔗 `<Routes>` and `<Route>`

* `<Routes>` is a container for all your routes
* `<Route>` defines one individual path/component pair

Example:

```tsx
<Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
```

#### 🔀 `<Link>` for Navigation

Don’t use `<a href="...">` — it causes a full page reload.
Use:

```tsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

<Link to="/about">Go to About</Link>
```

This lets React handle the route **without a refresh**.

---

### 📦 Other Useful Components

#### 🧭 `useNavigate()` Hook

Programmatically navigate to another route:

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function LoginButton() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleLogin = () => {
    // after successful login
    navigate("/dashboard");
  };

  return <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>;
}
```

#### 📌 `useParams()` for Dynamic Routes

Useful for fetching a route parameter like `/:id`:

```tsx
<Route path="/users/:id" element={<UserProfile />} />
```

Inside `UserProfile` component:

```tsx
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

const { id } = useParams(); // grabs the `id` from the URL
```

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Mistake                                     | What Happens                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Using `<a>` instead of `<Link>`             | Full page reload              |
| Forgetting to wrap app in `<BrowserRouter>` | Routing won’t work            |
| Typo in `path` or `element`                 | Blank or broken route         |
| Nested routes without `Outlet`              | Child components don’t render |

---

### 🧱 Real-World Use Cases

* `/login` → Login page
* `/products/:id` → View details of a product
* `/dashboard` → Protected area after login
* Nested routes like `/settings/profile`, `/settings/security`

---

### ✅ Summary

* React Router allows you to build multi-page-like experiences in a single-page React app.
* Use `<BrowserRouter>` to enable routing
* Define paths with `<Route path="..." element={<Component />} />`
* Use `<Link>` for navigation and `useNavigate()` for programmatic redirects
* Dynamic routing allows passing IDs, slugs, etc. through the URL
