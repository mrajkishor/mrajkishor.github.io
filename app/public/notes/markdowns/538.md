# 🏗️ Building Static and Server-Side Apps for Production in Next.js  

## 🧭 Introduction

Next.js offers multiple rendering strategies — **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, and **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** — all designed for different use cases. But when it comes to **preparing your app for production**, knowing how to build and optimize for each mode is essential.

This guide covers how to build and optimize both **static** and **server-side** Next.js apps for production deployment.

---

## 🏁 1. Project Structure and Setup

Make sure your `next.config.js` is properly configured:

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  trailingSlash: false,
};
```

- ✅ `reactStrictMode`: Helps identify issues in development  
- ✅ `swcMinify`: Enables faster builds using the SWC compiler  
- ✅ `trailingSlash`: Consistent URLs

---

## 🏗️ 2. Building for Static Sites

If your pages use `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths`, they are statically rendered at **build time**.

### ✅ Build command:
```bash
npm run build
```

### ✅ Export command (for pure static):
```bash
next export
```

> This generates an `out/` folder that contains HTML, CSS, and JS files you can host on Netlify, GitHub Pages, or S3.

### 📌 Best suited for:
- Blogs
- Marketing sites
- Documentation

### ⚠️ Tips:
- Use `getStaticProps` to fetch data at build time
- Use CDN to cache static content
- Rebuild and re-deploy to reflect content changes (or use ISR)

---

## ⚙️ 3. Building for Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Pages using `getServerSideProps` are rendered **on every request**.

### ✅ Build command:
```bash
npm run build
```

> Generates the `.next/` folder, containing optimized pages and server code.

### ⚠️ You must deploy to a platform that supports SSR, like:
- Vercel
- AWS Lambda (via Serverless)
- Node server (`next start`)
- Firebase Functions

### 📌 Best suited for:
- User dashboards
- Auth-protected pages
- Real-time data apps

---

## 🧪 4. Testing Production Build Locally

After running `npm run build`, you can simulate production using:

```bash
npm start
```

> This runs the server with built assets in `.next/`.

---

## 🚀 5. Optimizations for Production

- **Minification**: SWC compiles faster with smaller bundle size.
- **Image Optimization**: Use `next/image` for automatic resizing, lazy loading.
- **Font Optimization**: Use `next/font` (Next.js 13+) for performance.
- **Code Splitting**: Next.js does it automatically.
- **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code during build.

## 🧠 6. Static vs. Server: When to Use What?

| Feature              | Static (SSG/Export)       | Server (SSR)                |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| SEO Friendly         | ✅ Yes                    | ✅ Yes                      |
| Real-time data       | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes                      |
| CDN-cachable         | ✅ Fully                  | ⚠️ Partial                  |
| Needs a backend      | ❌ No (optional APIs)     | ✅ Yes                      |
| Cost-effective       | ✅ More                   | ⚠️ Depends on infra        |
| Fast load speed      | ✅ Very fast              | ⚠️ Depends on server time  |

## 📦 7. Output Structure After Build

After `npm run build`, you’ll get:

```
.next/
├── static/
├── server/
├── cache/
├── routes-manifest.json
├── build-manifest.json
```

> Avoid modifying `.next/` directly. It's the compiled output used by `next start` or your deployment platform.

---

## ✅ 8. Environment Variables

Set your variables in `.env.production`:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
API_URL=https://api.myapp.com
```

They get injected only during the build process.

---

## 🧰 9. Optional Enhancements

- Add `next-sitemap`, `next-seo` for production SEO setup
- Add bundle analyzer:
  ```bash
  npm install @next/bundle-analyzer
  ```

  ```js
  const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
    enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
  });
  module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({});
  ```

- Add error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)

---

## 🛠 Example: Build Script in `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "export": "next export"
  }
}
```

---

## 💡 Final Thoughts

Whether your Next.js app is **fully static**, **server-rendered**, or **hybrid**, optimizing the build process and choosing the right deployment strategy ensures scalability, performance, and reliability in production.
