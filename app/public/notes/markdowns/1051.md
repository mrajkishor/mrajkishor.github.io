### **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

---

## 🚀 What is Dijkstra’s Algorithm?

**Dijkstra’s Algorithm** is a **greedy-based algorithm** that computes the **shortest path from a single source** to all other vertices in a **weighted graph** where **edge weights are non-negative**.

---

## 🎯 When to Use

Use Dijkstra’s algorithm when:

* The graph is **weighted**
* **All edge weights are non-negative**
* You need the **shortest distance from one source** to all nodes

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

The algorithm works by:

1. Assigning a tentative distance to all nodes (`∞` initially), and `0` to the source.
2. Iteratively picking the **unvisited node with the smallest known distance**.
3. Updating the distance of its neighbors if a shorter path is found through the current node.
4. Repeating until all nodes are visited or finalized.

It **guarantees the shortest path** due to its greedy nature and the non-negative edge weight constraint.

## 🧮 Step-by-Step Algorithm (Min-Heap Version – Efficient)

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, src, V):
    dist = [float('inf')] * V
    dist[src] = 0
    pq = [(0, src)]  # (distance, node)

    while pq:
        current_dist, u = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_dist > dist[u]:
            continue  # Skip outdated entry

        for v, weight in graph[u]:
            if dist[v] > dist[u] + weight:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))

    return dist
```

* `graph[u]` returns list of tuples `(v, weight)`
* `dist[i]` gives shortest distance from `src` to node `i`

## 🧪 Example

**Graph:**

```
        1
   (0)-----→(1)
    |        |
  4 |        | 2
    ↓        ↓
   (2)←----- (3)
       5
```

* `graph = [[(1,1), (2,4)], [(3,2)], [(3,5)], []]`
* `src = 0`
* Output: `dist = [0, 1, 4, 3]`

## 🧾 Time & Space Complexity

| Variant       | Time Complexity      | Space Complexity |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Naive (Array) | O(V²)                | O(V)             |
| Heap (PQ)     | **O((V + E) log V)** | O(V + E)         |

* `V`: number of vertices
* `E`: number of edges
* The priority queue (min-heap) ensures efficient retrieval of the node with the smallest distance.

## ⚠️ Important Notes for GATE

| Concept                 | Explanation                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Negative Weights      | Dijkstra **does NOT** work with negative edge weights. Use **Bellman-Ford** instead.                                    |
| ✅ Optimality            | Guarantees shortest paths if all edge weights are non-negative                                                          |
| ⛓️ Greedy               | Relies on always choosing the node with the currently known shortest distance                                           |
| 🛠️ Used In             | GPS navigation, routing algorithms, network protocols                                                                   |

## 📌 Dry Run Example

**Graph:**

```
A --(1)--> B --(2)--> D  
A --(4)--> C --(5)--> D
```

**Steps:**

* Init: `dist = {A:0, B:∞, C:∞, D:∞}`
* Visit A → update B=1, C=4
* Visit B (min dist) → D = min(∞, 1+2) = 3
* Visit C → D = min(3, 4+5) = 3 → no update
* Final: `dist = {A:0, B:1, C:4, D:3}`

## 🧠 Dijkstra vs BFS

| Feature        | BFS          | Dijkstra              |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Graph Type     | Unweighted   | Weighted (non-neg)    |
| Data Structure | Queue (FIFO) | Min-Heap (Priority Q) |
| Complexity     | O(V + E)     | O((V + E) log V)      |
| Optimal for    | Fewest edges | Least weight/cost     |

* Google Maps and GPS routing
* Network routing (e.g., OSPF protocol)
* Game AI pathfinding
* Robot navigation in grid environments

## 📝 Summary

* Dijkstra’s is **greedy**, **efficient**, and works only for **non-negative** weighted graphs
* Use **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)** for optimal performance
* Does **not** detect negative weight cycles
* Appears frequently in **GATE**, often as:

  * MCQs about distance arrays
  * Fill-in-the-blank cost traces
  * Dry-run analysis
