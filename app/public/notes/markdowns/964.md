## üìò Structured Query Language (SQL) ‚Äì GATE-Level Notes

---

### üîπ What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standard language used for managing and querying relational databases.
It allows us to **create**, **manipulate**, and **retrieve** data stored in relational tables.

SQL is declarative ‚Äî we specify *what* we want, not *how* to get it.

### üîπ Categories of SQL Commands

| Category                           | Purpose                  | Common Commands                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| DDL (Data Definition Language)     | Define and modify schema | `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`              |
| DML (Data Manipulation Language)   | Modify table data        | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` |
| DCL (Data Control Language)        | Permissions              | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`                      |
| TCL (Transaction Control Language) | Manage transactions      | `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`      |

### üîπ 1. Basic SQL Operations

#### ‚úÖ `SELECT` ‚Äì Retrieve data

```sql
SELECT Name, Age FROM Student WHERE Age > 20;
```

#### ‚úÖ `INSERT` ‚Äì Add new rows

```sql
INSERT INTO Student (ID, Name, Age) VALUES (101, 'Raj', 21);
```

#### ‚úÖ `UPDATE` ‚Äì Modify existing rows

```sql
UPDATE Student SET Age = 22 WHERE ID = 101;
```

#### ‚úÖ `DELETE` ‚Äì Remove rows

```sql
DELETE FROM Student WHERE ID = 101;
```

---

### üîπ 2. Filtering Results

#### ‚úÖ WHERE Clause

```sql
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE Age > 20 AND Name LIKE 'A%';
```

#### ‚úÖ Logical Operators

* `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
* `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`

---

### üîπ 3. Aggregate Functions

Used to perform calculations on multiple rows:

| Function          | Description          |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| `COUNT()`         | Total number of rows |
| `SUM()`           | Total of values      |
| `AVG()`           | Average value        |
| `MIN()` / `MAX()` | Lowest / Highest     |

```sql
SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE Department = 'HR';
```

---

### üîπ 4. GROUP BY and HAVING

#### ‚úÖ `GROUP BY`

Groups rows that have the same value in one or more columns.

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employee GROUP BY Department;
```

#### ‚úÖ `HAVING`

Filters groups after aggregation.

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employee GROUP BY Department HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

---

### üîπ 5. Joins

Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

| Type              | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `INNER JOIN`      | Returns only matching rows                  |
| `LEFT JOIN`       | All rows from left, matched rows from right |
| `RIGHT JOIN`      | All rows from right, matched from left      |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN` | All matching and non-matching rows          |

```sql
SELECT S.Name, E.Course
FROM Student S
INNER JOIN Enroll E ON S.ID = E.StudentID;
```

---

### üîπ 6. Subqueries (Nested Queries)

* **Scalar subquery**: Returns a single value
* **Row subquery**: Returns a row
* **Table subquery**: Returns a table
* **Correlated subquery**: Depends on outer query

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Student
WHERE Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Student);
```

---

### üîπ 7. Set Operations

Used to combine results from multiple queries:

| Operation           | Use                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `UNION`             | Combine results, remove duplicates     |
| `UNION ALL`         | Combine results, keep duplicates       |
| `INTERSECT`         | Common rows                            |
| `EXCEPT` or `MINUS` | Rows in one query but not in the other |

---

### üîπ 8. Integrity Constraints

These are rules to ensure data accuracy and consistency:

| Constraint    | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `PRIMARY KEY` | Uniquely identifies a row (not null + unique) |
| `FOREIGN KEY` | Ensures referential integrity between tables  |
| `UNIQUE`      | All values in a column must be different      |
| `NOT NULL`    | Disallows null values                         |
| `CHECK`       | Restricts values based on condition           |
| `DEFAULT`     | Sets default value when none is provided      |

#### ‚úÖ Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18)
);
```

---

### üîπ 9. Dealing with NULLs

* `NULL` means *unknown* or *missing*
* Comparisons involving `NULL` return `UNKNOWN`, not true/false

Use `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`

```sql
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE Age IS NULL;
```

---

### üß† GATE Tips

* üí° Be fluent in writing `SELECT` queries with filters, joins, and groupings.
* üí° Understand how different joins affect the result.
* üí° GATE often asks logic-based questions on aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` behavior.
* üí° Practice translating relational algebra to SQL and vice versa.
* üí° Know how `NULL` behaves in comparison and aggregation.

### üßæ Summary Recap Table

| Concept        | Example                               |

| Basic Query    | `SELECT * FROM Table`                 |
| Join           | `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`             |
| Grouping       | `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`                  |

### ‚úÖ Final Thought

GATE doesn't test obscure SQL features. Focus on **data retrieval**, **constraints**, **joins**, and **aggregation**. With solid practice of **PYQs** and **concept-based MCQs**, this topic is highly scoreable.
