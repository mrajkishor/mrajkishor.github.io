### **3.1 Introduction to Functions and Their Types**

A **function** is a special type of relation where **every input has exactly one output**. In simpler terms, if you feed a value into a function, it gives back only one answer.

We usually write a function as:

```
y = f(x)
```

Here, **x** is the input (also called the **independent variable**) and **y** is the output (the **dependent variable**).

---

### 💡 **What is a Function in Mathematics?**

Imagine a machine: you give it an input, it processes it, and gives you one output. That’s what a function is — a rule that assigns exactly **one output for each input**.

* The set of allowed inputs is called the **domain**.
* The set of possible outputs is called the **codomain** (or sometimes, **range**).

For example,
If `f(x) = x²`, then:

* f(2) = 4
* f(3) = 9
* f(-1) = 1

Each `x` gives **one and only one** value of `f(x)`.

---

### 🧠 **Types of Functions in Maths**

Here are some common types of functions:

1. **Injective Function (One-to-One)**
   Every element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain.
   ➤ No two inputs have the same output.

2. **Surjective Function (Onto)**
   Every element in the codomain is covered. That means **all** outputs in the codomain are “hit” by some input.

3. **Polynomial Function**
   A function involving powers of x like `f(x) = x² + 2x + 1`.

4. **Inverse Function**
   If a function takes you from x to y, the inverse takes you back from y to x.
   Example: If `f(x) = 2x`, then `f⁻¹(x) = x/2`.

---

### ✏️ **What is a Function in Algebra?**

In algebra, a function is simply an equation where each `x` value gives **only one** `y`.

Some examples:

* `y = 2x + 1`
* `y = 3x – 2`
* `y = 5/x`
* `y = √x` (for x ≥ 0)

Here, `x` is the **independent variable** — we choose its value.
And `y` depends on `x` — so it’s called the **dependent variable**.

---

### 📈 **Graphing a Function**

To graph a function, pick values of `x`, compute the corresponding `y`, and plot those (x, y) points on a coordinate plane.

Let’s take an example:

**Function:** `y = x + 3`

Now, compute some values:

| x  | y = x + 3 |
| -- | --------- |
| -2 | 1         |
| -1 | 2         |
| 0  | 3         |
| 1  | 4         |
| 2  | 5         |

Now, plot these points on a graph, and you’ll get a **straight line**.

---

### ✅ Summary

* A **function** gives one output for each input.
* It's written as `f(x)` or `y = f(x)`.
* Functions can be graphed by plotting x and y pairs.
* There are many types like injective, surjective, polynomial, and inverse functions.

---

### **3.2 Function in Computer Science**

In programming, a **function** is like a reusable piece of code that performs a specific task. Instead of writing the same logic over and over, we define a function once and use it whenever needed.

You can think of functions as small **building blocks** that help break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. Once a function is written, we don’t need to worry about how it works internally — we just call it when required.

---

### 🔁 **Calling a Function**

To use a function, we just write its **name** followed by **parentheses**. If the function needs any input values (called **parameters**), we pass them inside the parentheses.

Example:

```python
print("hello world")
```

Here, `print` is the function and `"hello world"` is the input. It tells the computer to show that message on the screen.

Even if a function doesn’t need any input, we **still need parentheses**:

```python
print()  # Valid
print    # Invalid – this just refers to a variable, not a function call
```

---

### 📦 **Importing Functions from Libraries**

Some useful functions are not available by default. We have to **import** them from modules (libraries). For example:

```python
from time import sleep

print("Waiting 5 seconds...")
sleep(5)
print("Done")
```

Here, `sleep(5)` pauses the program for 5 seconds. But before we can use it, we must import it from the **time** module.

---

### 🛠️ **Creating (Defining) a New Function**

Suppose we often want to print every item in a list. Instead of repeating the loop each time, we can create a function:

```python
# Sample list
shopping_list = ["Bread", "Milk", "Apples", "Chocolate"]

# Function definition
def display_list():
    for item in shopping_list:
        print(item)

# Calling the function
display_list()
```

Later, if we add a new item:

```python
shopping_list.append("Sugar")
display_list()
```

This makes our code **cleaner**, more **organized**, and **reusable**.

---

### 🔤 **Structure of a Function Definition**

Here's how a typical function looks in Python:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # indented block of code (called the body)
    # do something
```

* `def`: keyword that tells Python we’re defining a function
* `function_name`: any valid name you choose
* `parameters`: inputs the function might need (can be empty)
* `:` and indentation: mark the beginning of the function’s body

---

### 🔄 **Function vs. Method vs. Procedure**

You might hear other terms:

* **Function**: A named block of code that can be reused, may or may not return something.
* **Method**: A function that belongs to an object (e.g., list, string).
* **Procedure**: A function that performs a task **without returning a value** (used in other languages like Pascal).

In this course, we’ll mostly use the word **function** for all.

Example of a method:

```python
shopping_list.append("Sugar")
```

Here, `append` is a **method** of the list object `shopping_list`. It’s just like a function, but specifically attached to a list.

---

### ✅ **Summary**

* Functions help avoid repetition and keep code neat.
* You **call** a function using its name and parentheses.
* You can also **create** your own functions using `def`.
* Some functions are **built-in**, others need to be **imported**.
* A **method** is just a function that belongs to an object.

### **3.3 Discrete Numeric Functions**

In mathematics and computer science, **functions** are a way to connect elements from one set to exactly one element in another set. They're especially useful when working with algorithms, counting problems, sequences, and even strings.

---

### 🔄 **What Is a Function?**

A **function** (written as **f: X → Y**) assigns **each element of set X** (called the **domain**) to **one and only one element in set Y** (called the **codomain**).

In this mapping:

* `x ∈ X` is called the **pre-image**
* `y ∈ Y` is the **image**, where `f(x) = y`

📌 **Key Rule**:
A function **must not** map a single input `x` to more than one output `y`. (So, one-to-many is **not** allowed.)

---

### 🔢 **Types of Functions**

#### 1. **Injective Function (One-to-One)**

A function is **injective** if **no two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain**.

In other words:

> If `a1 ≠ a2`, then `f(a1) ≠ f(a2)`

✅ **Example:**

* `f: N → N`, defined by `f(x) = 5x`
  This is injective because each input produces a unique output.
* `f(x) = x²` is also injective if the domain is **N** (natural numbers), but **not injective** over **R** (real numbers), since `f(2) = f(-2)`.

---

#### 2. **Surjective Function (Onto)**

A function is **surjective** if **every element in the codomain is the image of *at least one* element from the domain**.

In other words:

> For every `y ∈ Y`, there exists some `x ∈ X` such that `f(x) = y`.

✅ **Example:**

* `f: N → N`, `f(x) = x + 2`
  This is surjective — every number in the codomain has a pre-image.

❌ **Non-example:**

* `f: R → R`, `f(x) = x²`
  This is **not** surjective because there’s no real number whose square is **negative**.

---

#### 3. **Bijective Function (One-to-One Correspondence)**

A function is **bijective** if it is both:

* **Injective** (one-to-one) and
* **Surjective** (onto)

In a bijective function:

* Every element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain
* And every element in the codomain is mapped **exactly once**

---

### ✅ **Proving a Function is Bijective**

Let’s prove that the function `f: R → R`, defined by:

> `f(x) = 2x – 3`

is bijective.

**Step 1: Injective?**

Assume:

> `f(x₁) = f(x₂)`

Then:

> `2x₁ – 3 = 2x₂ – 3`

Solving gives:

> `x₁ = x₂`

✅ So it's **injective**

---

**Step 2: Surjective?**

We need to show that **for any** `y ∈ R`, there exists some `x ∈ R` such that `f(x) = y`.

From:

> `f(x) = 2x – 3`

Solve for `x`:

> `x = (y + 3) / 2`

Since this value of `x` is a real number for any real `y`, the function is:

✅ **Surjective**

---

Since the function is both injective **and** surjective, we conclude:

> 🔁 **f(x) = 2x – 3** is a **bijective function**.

---



## **3.4 Composition of Functions**

In simple terms, **function composition** means applying one function to the result of another.

If we have:

* `f: A → B`
* `g: B → C`

Then the **composition** of `f` followed by `g` is written as:

> **(g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x))**

You're first passing `x` through `f`, and then taking that output and passing it into `g`.

---

### ✨ **Example 1:**

Let:

* `f(x) = 2x + 3`
* `g(x) = x²`

Now:

* **(g ∘ f)(x)** = `g(f(x))`
  \= `g(2x + 3)`
  \= `(2x + 3)²`

* **(f ∘ g)(x)** = `f(g(x))`
  \= `f(x²)`
  \= `2x² + 3`

🔁 Order matters! `(g ∘ f)(x)` is not the same as `(f ∘ g)(x)`

---

## **3.5 Invertible Functions**

A function is **invertible** if you can "reverse" it — in other words, if you can go **backward** from output to input using another function.

The inverse of a function `f` is written as `f⁻¹`.

---

### ✅ **Condition for Invertibility**

A function must be:

1. **One-to-One** (Injective) → No two inputs map to the same output
2. **Onto** (Surjective) → Every output in the codomain has a pre-image in the domain

Together, this means the function is **bijective**, and thus **invertible**.

---

### 🔄 **Finding the Inverse:**

**Example:**
Let `f(x) = x + 7`

To find `f⁻¹(x)`, follow these steps:

1. Replace `f(x)` with `y`:
   `y = x + 7`
2. Solve for `x`:
   `x = y - 7`
3. Swap `x` and `y` for final answer:
   `f⁻¹(x) = x - 7`

---

### 🧠 **Key Properties of Inverse Functions:**

* Inverses only exist for **bijective** functions
* If `g` is the inverse of `f`, then `f` is the inverse of `g`
* `f(g(x)) = x` and `g(f(x)) = x` if and only if `f` and `g` are inverses
* Domain of `f` = Range of `f⁻¹`, and vice versa

---

### 🧪 **Example: Proving Invertibility**

Let:

* `A = R – {3}`
* `B = R – {1}`
* `f(x) = (x – 2) / (x – 3)`

🔹 **Step 1: One-to-One?**

Assume:
`f(x) = f(y)`

Then:
`(x – 2)/(x – 3) = (y – 2)/(y – 3)`

Cross-multiplying and simplifying gives:
`x = y`

✅ So, it's injective.

---

🔹 **Step 2: Onto?**

Let `y = f(x) = (x – 2)/(x – 3)`

Solve for `x`:

```
y = (x – 2)/(x – 3)
xy – 3y = x – 2
x(y – 1) = 3y – 2
x = (3y – 2)/(y – 1)
```

Since this `x` exists for all `y ≠ 1`, and codomain = range = R – {1} → ✅ It is **onto**

---

### ✅ So, f(x) is invertible.

Now, the inverse is:

> `f⁻¹(x) = (3x – 2)/(x – 1)`

---


## **3.6 Recursive Functions (in Computer Science and Math)**

A **recursive function** is a function that *calls itself* during its execution. Think of it like a loop that works by breaking down a problem into smaller chunks, solving one at a time until it reaches a simple case (called the **base case**).

---

### 🧠 Why use recursion?

* Recursion helps avoid repeating code.
* It’s ideal for problems that can be broken into smaller, similar subproblems — like computing factorials, Fibonacci numbers, traversing trees, or solving mazes.

---

### 📌 Structure of a Recursive Function:

Every recursive function must have:

1. **Base case** – a condition where the recursion stops.
2. **Recursive step** – where the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler input.

---

### 🔁 Example: Factorial (Mathematical Definition)

Let’s define factorial:

* `fact(0) = 1`   ← base case
* `fact(n) = n × fact(n-1)` ← recursive step

So:

```
fact(4)
= 4 × fact(3)
= 4 × 3 × fact(2)
= 4 × 3 × 2 × fact(1)
= 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 × fact(0)
= 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 1 = 24
```

The function keeps calling itself until it hits `fact(0)`, which is predefined as 1. From there, it *unwinds* all the calls.

---

## **3.7 Generating Functions**

A **generating function** is a powerful mathematical tool to represent sequences (like `1, 2, 3, 4,...`) using power series. It’s often used to solve **recurrence relations**, **counting problems**, and **combinatorics**.

---

### 🔍 What it looks like:

If we have a sequence:

`a₀, a₁, a₂, a₃, ...`

Then the generating function is:

> **G(t) = a₀ + a₁t + a₂t² + a₃t³ + ...**

This compact form captures all terms of the sequence in one algebraic expression.

---

### 💡 Examples:

#### **1. Constant sequence:**

`1, 1, 1, 1, ...`

Then:

> `G(t) = 1 + t + t² + t³ + ... = 1 / (1 - t)`  ← \[Geometric series]

So from this, we can say:

* a₀ = 1, a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1, etc.

---

#### **2. Sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...**

This is like multiplying the first generating function by `1 / (1 - t)` again:

> `G(t) = 1 / (1 - t)²`

And that gives:

> `G(t) = 1 + 2t + 3t² + 4t³ + ...`

So here:

* a₀ = 1, a₁ = 2, a₂ = 3, etc.

---

#### **3. Sequence: Z⁰, Z¹, Z², Z³, ...**

For a constant `Z ≠ 0`:

> `G(t) = 1 + Zt + Z²t² + Z³t³ + ... = 1 / (1 - Zt)`

Assuming `|Zt| < 1`

---

### 🧪 Combining Generating Functions

If:

* First sequence: a₁(r) with generating function G₁(t)
* Second sequence: a₂(r) with generating function G₂(t)

Then a **linear combination**:

> λ₁a₁(r) + λ₂a₂(r)
> has generating function:
> **λ₁G₁(t) + λ₂G₂(t)**

(where λ₁, λ₂ are constants)
