---

## 🔹 1. **What is a Hash Table?**

A **hash table** (or **hash map**) is a **key-value data structure** that allows for **fast insertion, deletion, and lookup** — typically in **O(1)** time on average.

It uses a **hash function** to map keys to an index in an **array-like structure**, where the value is stored.

---

### ✅ Real-Life Analogy:

* Think of a **dictionary**: You search for a word (key) and instantly get its definition (value).
* Hash tables **simulate** this behavior with arrays and hash functions.

---

## 🔹 2. **Hash Function**

A **hash function** converts a key (string, number, etc.) into a valid index in the hash table.

### ✅ Ideal Hash Function Characteristics:

* **Deterministic**: Same key → always same index
* **Uniform Distribution**: Spreads keys evenly
* **Fast**: Should compute quickly
* **Minimize Collisions**: Different keys → different indexes

---

## 🔹 3. **Collision Handling Techniques**

Two or more keys may map to the same index — this is called a **collision**. It must be resolved correctly.

### 🔸 a) **Chaining (Separate Chaining)**

* Each index in the hash table stores a **linked list** (or list/chain) of key-value pairs.
* When collision occurs, new key is added to the list at that index.

#### ✅ Example:

```text
Index 3: → (33, "A") → (93, "B") → ...
```

#### Pros:

* Easy to implement
* Load factor > 1 is allowed

#### Cons:

* Requires extra space for lists
* Worst case time: O(n)

---

### 🔸 b) **Open Addressing**

All entries are stored **within the table**. On collision, a **probing sequence** is used to find the next empty slot.

#### Types of Probing:

| Type               | Formula for probe sequence |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Linear**         | `h(k) + i`                 |
| **Quadratic**      | `h(k) + c₁·i + c₂·i²`      |
| **Double Hashing** | `h1(k) + i·h2(k)`          |

> `i` is the probe count (0, 1, 2...)
> All formulas are taken modulo table size.

---

### ✅ Linear Probing Example:

* Table size = 7
* Hash function: `h(k) = k % 7`

Insert keys: 10, 20, 15

* 10 → 3
* 20 → 6
* 15 → 1

All go to unique positions. Now insert 17

* 17 % 7 = 3 → collision → try index 4 → success

## 🔹 4. **Load Factor (α)**

```
α = number of elements / table size
```

| Load Factor             | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| α < 0.7 (Open Addr)     | Good performance                         |
| α can be > 1 (Chaining) | Because multiple items per index allowed |

---

## 🔹 5. **Time Complexity Summary**

| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case                               |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Insert    | O(1)         | O(n) (collision chain full)              |
| Search    | O(1)         | O(n) (in case of clustering or bad hash) |
| Delete    | O(1)         | O(n) if chain is long or probe fails     |

> Good hash function and load factor control keep operations near **O(1)**.

## 🔹 6. **Applications of Hash Tables**

| Use Case                  | Description                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Dictionaries / Maps**   | Store key-value pairs                 |
| **Database Indexing**     | Fast lookup of rows via keys          |
| **Compiler Symbol Table** | Store variable names and metadata     |
| **Caching**               | Fast memory lookup (e.g., LRU cache)  |
| **Duplicate Detection**   | Hash set to detect duplicates in O(1) |

## 🔹 7. **Common GATE-Level Pitfalls**

| Trap / Concept                    | Explanation                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Using poor hash function          | Leads to clustering and poor performance      |
| Forgetting to rehash table        | When load factor exceeds threshold            |
| Infinite probing loop             | Can occur if table is full in open addressing |
| Deletion holes in open addressing | Must handle with tombstones or shifting       |
| Assuming BST-like ordering        | Hash tables are **unordered**                 |

## 🔹 8. **Hash Table vs Other Data Structures**

| Feature      | Hash Table | BST (Balanced) | Array/List |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Avg search   | O(1)       | O(log n)       | O(n)       |
| Ordered?     | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Partial  |
| Worst search | O(n)       | O(log n)       | O(n)       |
| Dynamic?     | ✅          | ✅              | ✅          |
