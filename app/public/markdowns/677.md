### üîê **Overview of the Goals of Information Security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)**

The CIA Triad‚Äî**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**‚Äîis the foundational model for designing and evaluating information security systems. It ensures data is protected from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.

---

### üîí 1. Confidentiality

**Definition**: Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals.

**Purpose**:

* Prevents data breaches and information leaks.
* Protects personal and corporate privacy.

**Techniques**:

* **Encryption**: Converts data into unreadable form (ciphertext) unless decrypted.
* **Access Control**: Restricts access based on roles or permissions.
* **Authentication**: Validates user identities using passwords, biometrics, or 2FA.

**Example**: In banks, customer account details are protected so only authorized employees can access them.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 2. Integrity

**Definition**: Ensures data is accurate, consistent, and unaltered unless authorized.

**Purpose**:

* Prevents unauthorized modification of information.
* Maintains data trustworthiness.

**Techniques**:

* **Hashing**: Generates a unique hash for data to detect tampering.
* **Checksums**: Verifies data integrity during transmission.
* **Digital Signatures**: Confirms sender identity and data unchanged.

**Example**: Financial records must retain integrity to ensure correct tax filings and compliance.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Availability

**Definition**: Ensures authorized users have access to information and systems when needed.

**Purpose**:

* Maintains business continuity.
* Supports operational efficiency.

**Techniques**:

* **Redundancy**: Backup servers or storage in case of failure.
* **Failover Systems**: Automatically take over when primary systems fail.
* **Regular Maintenance and Updates**: Keep systems operational and secure.

**Example**: E-commerce websites must ensure uptime during peak shopping seasons like Diwali or New Year.

## üîê **Introduction to Security Services and Basic Network Security Terminology**

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Services**

Security services protect information systems by enforcing security policies. The major services include:

#### 1. **Authentication**

* **What**: Verifies user identity.
* **Methods**:

  * Passwords
  * Biometrics (e.g., fingerprints)
  * Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

#### 2. **Authorization**

* **What**: Grants or denies access to resources.
* **Techniques**:

  * **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Access based on user role.
  * **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**: Permissions per user/group.

#### 3. **Non-repudiation**

* **What**: Ensures a party cannot deny an action (like sending a message).
* **Tool**: Digital signatures to verify authorship and content.

#### 4. **Audit**

* **What**: Records and monitors user actions.
* **Use**: Helps detect breaches and support legal proceedings.

### üß† **Basic Network Security Terminology**

Understanding these terms is essential for building and managing secure networks:

| Term                                  | Definition                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Firewall**                          | Monitors and filters network traffic based on rules.   |
| **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**  | Detects suspicious activity and alerts administrators. |
| **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** | Detects and blocks threats in real time.               |
| **Malware**                           | Malicious software like viruses, worms, ransomware.    |
| **Encryption**                        | Converts data into unreadable form without a key.      |
| **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**     | Creates a secure tunnel for online communications.     |

---

### üáÆüá≥ **Security Services in the Indian Context**

* **Sectors like banking, healthcare, and e-governance** have increased dependence on cybersecurity.
* **RBI regulations** require banks to use **encryption** and **2FA** for online transactions.

#### üîé **Case Study: Aadhaar Security**

* Aadhaar, India‚Äôs biometric identity system (1+ billion users), is secured by:

  * **Encryption** of stored and transmitted data.
  * **Biometric authentication** for access.
  * **Continuous vulnerability scanning** to prevent breaches.

### ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

The CIA Triad and foundational security services (Authentication, Authorization, Non-repudiation, and Audit) together create a secure framework. With threats evolving rapidly, organizations must adopt robust techniques and stay updated with security best practices. In India, projects like Aadhaar demonstrate the critical need for well-implemented information security principles.
