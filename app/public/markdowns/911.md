# ⚙️ `call`, `put`, `fork`, `cancel`, `race`

When building real-world applications — especially complex user workflows like login, file uploads, timeouts, search, and background sync — you need a way to handle **asynchronous tasks declaratively and safely**.

Redux-Saga gives you powerful tools to **manage async side effects** through special helper functions called **effects**. Among these, the five most essential ones — and the ones used by every senior engineer working with sagas — are:

> `call`, `put`, `fork`, `cancel`, and `race`

Let’s unpack these, with examples, real-life use cases, and Enterprise-level insight.

## 🧠 1. `call(fn, ...args)` — Blocking Function Call

```js
const response = yield call(api.login, payload);
```

### 🔍 What It Does:

* Invokes a **function**, and **waits** for its result before continuing.
* Usually used to call **API functions**, database logic, or any promise-based operation.
* It’s blocking — the saga **pauses** until the call is resolved or rejected.

### ✅ Why Use It:

* Keeps control flow **predictable**
* Helps you mock APIs easily in tests
* Best for **step-by-step async operations**

### 📌 Real-World Example:

```js
const result = yield call(api.submitForm, formData);
```

> Think of it as a `yielded await`.

## 📤 2. `put(action)` — Dispatch a Redux Action

```js
yield put({ type: "LOGIN_SUCCESS", payload: response });
```

### 🔍 What It Does:

* Dispatches an action **from within the saga** — just like `dispatch()` in React.
* The action goes through the Redux flow → hits reducers and middleware.

### ✅ Why Use It:

* Update store after API call success/failure
* Trigger loading states or UI transitions
* Log errors to state

### 📌 Real-World Example:

```js
yield put({ type: "FETCH_PRODUCTS_FAILED", error: err });
```

> Think of it as “I’ve done my side effect — now tell the store.”

---

## 🔄 3. `fork(fn, ...args)` — Non-Blocking Task

```js
const task = yield fork(syncUserData);
```

### 🔍 What It Does:

* Starts a **non-blocking** task (in parallel).
* Returns a **task object** that you can **cancel**, **monitor**, or **race**.
* The parent saga continues **immediately** — it doesn’t wait.

### ✅ Why Use It:

* Fire-and-forget jobs (e.g., background polling)
* Running sagas concurrently
* When you want to **cancel** later

### 📌 Real-World Example:

```js
yield fork(startWebSocketConnection);
```

> Think of it as spawning a new thread in the saga world.

## ❌ 4. `cancel(task)` — Kill a Forked Task

```js
const task = yield fork(longUpload);
yield cancel(task);
```

### 🔍 What It Does:

* Cancels a **running forked task**
* Only works on tasks created with `fork()`

### ✅ Why Use It:

* Cancel an **in-progress upload**, search, or animation
* Stop polling when user navigates away
* Prevent duplicate network requests

### 📌 Real-World Example:

```js
if (userCancelled) {
  yield cancel(uploadTask);
  yield put({ type: "UPLOAD_CANCELED" });
}
```

> This is critical for responsive UX — don’t let stale requests win.

---

## ⚔️ 5. `race({...})` — Compete Between Tasks

```js
const { timeout, response } = yield race({
  timeout: delay(5000),
  response: call(api.fetchData),
});
```

### 🔍 What It Does:

* Runs multiple effects in parallel
* Whichever finishes **first** wins
* All others are **automatically canceled**

### ✅ Why Use It:

* Implement **timeouts**
* Cancel one task if another wins (e.g. user closes modal)
* Handle **user interrupts** or fast-fail conditions

### 📌 Real-World Example:

```js
const { result, cancel } = yield race({
  result: call(fetchSomething),
  cancel: take("CANCEL_FETCH"),
});
```

> “Give me the first responder — forget the rest.”

## 🧪 Putting It All Together: Login Flow with Timeout and Cancel

```js
function* loginSaga(action) {
  try {
    const { response, timeout } = yield race({
      response: call(api.login, action.payload),
      timeout: delay(5000),
    });

    if (timeout) {
      yield put({ type: "LOGIN_TIMEOUT" });
    } else {
      yield put({ type: "LOGIN_SUCCESS", payload: response });
    }
  } catch (err) {
    yield put({ type: "LOGIN_FAILED", error: err });
  }
}
```

This is clean, testable, and handles every path: success, timeout, failure — exactly how a Enterprise engineer would structure a login saga.

## 🔁 Summary Table

| Effect   | Purpose                          | Blocking? | Cancelable? | Example Use Case            |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| `call`   | Calls async function             | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No        | API calls, form submissions |
| `put`    | Dispatches Redux action          | ❌ No      | ❌ No        | Updating store state        |
| `fork`   | Starts task in background        | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes       | Background sync, polling    |
| `cancel` | Cancels a running `fork`ed task  | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes       | Cancel search, file upload  |
| `race`   | Compete between multiple effects | ❌ No      | ✅ (auto)    | Timeouts, user interrupts   |

## 🧠 Enterprise-Level Tips

* Use `call` for step-by-step logic (auth, payments, sequential workflows)
* Use `fork + cancel` for user-cancelable actions (uploads, search, modals)
* Use `race` to implement timeouts or interruptable flows
* Always use `try/catch` around `call` to gracefully handle API failures
* For clean structure, pair `watcher` sagas (with `takeEvery` or `takeLatest`) with **worker** sagas using `call`, `put`, `fork`, etc.
