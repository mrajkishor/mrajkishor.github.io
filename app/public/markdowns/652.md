### 📌 **Overview of Authorization Techniques**

**Authorization** is a critical aspect of access control in information security. While **authentication** confirms a user's identity, **authorization** defines what that user is allowed to do within a system. It determines **which resources** a user can access and **what operations** they can perform based on predefined policies and roles.

---

### 🔐 **Definition of Access Control**

Access control is the mechanism used to **restrict access** to resources based on **user identity, role, ownership, attributes, or policies**. Its goal is to ensure that **only authorized users** can perform permitted actions on systems, files, or data.

---

### 🧩 **Major Authorization Models**

---

### 🔸 **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

**RBAC** assigns permissions to roles rather than directly to users. Users are then assigned roles based on their job responsibilities.

#### ✅ Key Features:

* Simplifies management in **large organizations**.
* Enables **easy permission updates** when users change roles.
* Enforces the principle of **least privilege**.

#### 📌 Example:

An employee in the **Finance** role can access payroll data but not modify HR records, while a user in **HR** can manage employee details but not financial statements.

---

### 🔸 **2. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**

In **DAC**, the **owner of a resource** determines access permissions. Users have the freedom to grant or revoke access to others.

#### ✅ Key Features:

* Highly **flexible** and user-controlled.
* Common in **personal computing** and file-sharing environments.

#### ⚠️ Drawbacks:

* **Prone to human error** or misuse.
* Users might accidentally share sensitive data with unauthorized individuals.

#### 📌 Example:

A user who creates a document in a shared drive can set it to be **read-only, editable, or restricted** to selected individuals.

---

### 🔸 **3. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**

**MAC** enforces strict access control policies managed by a central authority. Permissions are based on **security labels or classifications** assigned to both users and data.

#### ✅ Key Features:

* Highly **secure** and used in **military or government** contexts.
* Users **cannot change** access permissions themselves.

#### 📌 Example:

Documents classified as **"Top Secret"** can only be accessed by users with **"Top Secret Clearance"**—no exceptions or overrides.

---

### 🔸 **4. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

**ABAC** evaluates multiple attributes (user, resource, environment) to make dynamic access decisions. It is **policy-driven** and suitable for **complex systems**.

#### ✅ Key Features:

* Extremely **fine-grained** control.
* Supports **context-aware policies** (e.g., time of access, location, device type).
* Ideal for **cloud environments** and modern enterprise systems.

#### 📌 Example:

A user can access a document **only during business hours**, **only from the corporate network**, and **only if their device is secured**.

### ✅ **Conclusion**

Each authorization model serves a specific purpose:

| Model    | Control By        | Flexibility | Use Case                          |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **RBAC** | Role              | Moderate    | Enterprises with defined roles    |
| **DAC**  | Owner             | High        | File systems, shared environments |
| **MAC**  | Admin/Policy      | Low         | Military, classified data         |
| **ABAC** | Attributes/Policy | Very High   | Dynamic, cloud-based systems      |

Combining multiple models or choosing one based on system requirements ensures **both security and usability** in access control design.
