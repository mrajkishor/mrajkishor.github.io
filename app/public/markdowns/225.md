# Understanding Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

Prim's Algorithm is a greedy approach used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. The MST is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices with the smallest possible total edge weight, without forming any cycles.

In this blog, we will dive into the workings of Prim's Algorithm, its step-by-step implementation, different approaches, and analyze its time and space complexities.

## Key Features of Prim's Algorithm

1. **Incremental Growth**: Starts with an arbitrary vertex and grows the MST by adding the smallest edge that connects a visited vertex to an unvisited vertex.
2. **Greedy Strategy**: Chooses the smallest edge at each step to ensure a minimal total weight.
3. **Efficient for Dense Graphs**: Prim's Algorithm works efficiently on graphs with many edges.

### Applications:
- **Network Design**: Designing road networks, electrical circuits, or telecommunications links.
- **Clustering**: Grouping data points in hierarchical clustering algorithms.

## Steps of Prim's Algorithm

1. **Initialize**:
   - Select an arbitrary starting vertex.
   - Maintain a priority queue or a key array to store the smallest edge weight for each vertex.
   - Use a boolean array to track visited vertices.

2. **Iterative Selection**:
   - Extract the vertex with the smallest edge weight from the priority queue.
   - Mark it as visited.
   - Update the weights of its unvisited neighbors if a smaller edge is found.

3. **Repeat**:
   - Continue selecting vertices and updating weights until all vertices are included in the MST.

## Implementation of Prim's Algorithm

### Graph Representation
We use an adjacency matrix representation for simplicity.

#### Java Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Prim {
    public void primMST(int[][] graph, int vertices) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];
        int[] parent = new int[vertices];
        int[] key = new int[vertices];
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));

        Arrays.fill(key, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        key[0] = 0;
        parent[0] = -1;
        pq.offer(new int[]{0, 0});

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int u = pq.poll()[0];
            visited[u] = true;

            for (int v = 0; v < vertices; v++) {
                if (graph[u][v] != 0 && !visited[v] && graph[u][v] < key[v]) {
                    key[v] = graph[u][v];
                    parent[v] = u;
                    pq.offer(new int[]{v, key[v]});
                }
            }
        }

        printMST(parent, graph);
    }

    private void printMST(int[] parent, int[][] graph) {
        System.out.println("Edge \tWeight");
        for (int i = 1; i < graph.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(parent[i] + " - " + i + "\t" + graph[i][parent[i]]);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] graph = {
            {0, 2, 0, 6, 0},
            {2, 0, 3, 8, 5},
            {0, 3, 0, 0, 7},
            {6, 8, 0, 0, 9},
            {0, 5, 7, 9, 0}
        };

        Prim p = new Prim();
        p.primMST(graph, 5);
    }
}
```

### Output:
#### Graph:
```
   0 --(2)-- 1
   | \       |
  (6) (3)   (5)
   |     \   |
   3 --(7)-- 4
```
#### MST Output:
```
Edge    Weight
0 - 1   2
0 - 3   6
1 - 2   3
1 - 4   5
```

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. **Adjacency List Representation**
Using an adjacency list improves space efficiency for sparse graphs. The algorithm remains the same, but the neighbors of each vertex are stored as a list of edges.

### 2. **Binary Heap Optimization**
Using a binary heap instead of a simple priority queue further optimizes the algorithm's performance, reducing the complexity for dense graphs.

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- **Using Adjacency Matrix**:
  - \(O(V^2)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices.
- **Using Adjacency List with Priority Queue**:
  - \(O(E \log V)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.

### Space Complexity:
- \(O(V^2)\) for adjacency matrix.
- \(O(E + V)\) for adjacency list.

---

## Advantages of Prim's Algorithm
1. **Efficient for Dense Graphs**: Performs well when the number of edges is large.
2. **Simple Implementation**: The algorithm is straightforward to implement and understand.

---

## Limitations of Prim's Algorithm
1. **High Space Complexity**: Requires large memory for adjacency matrix representation in dense graphs.
2. **Single MST**: Prim's Algorithm produces only one MST, which might not be unique for graphs with equal edge weights.

## Example Execution for a Larger Graph
#### Input Graph:
```
   A --2-- B
   | \    /|
  (4) (6)(3)
   |   \  |
   C --8-- D
```
#### Adjacency Matrix Representation:
```
    A  B  C  D
A  [0, 2, 4, 6]
B  [2, 0, 0, 3]
C  [4, 0, 0, 8]
D  [6, 3, 8, 0]
```
#### Output:
```
Edge    Weight
A - B     2
A - C     4
B - D     3
```
