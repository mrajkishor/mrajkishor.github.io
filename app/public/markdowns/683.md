### 🧩 Microfrontend Design Approaches – **Horizontal Split**

---

#### 🔹 What is Horizontal Split?

The **Horizontal Split** approach in Microfrontend architecture refers to dividing a single application by **layers or concerns across the horizontal stack** — typically **layout-level** or **page-section-level** responsibilities — rather than by feature or domain.

---

#### 🧱 Example Use Case:

Imagine an e-commerce site. In a horizontal split:

* The **Header (Navbar, Login/Profile)** is managed by one microfrontend.
* The **Main Content (product list or details)** is handled by another.
* The **Footer** (links, legal notices, contact info) is rendered by a third.

Each of these is independently developed and deployed by separate teams.

---

#### ✅ Advantages:

1. **Clear Separation of Layout Responsibility**
   Teams focus on specific screen zones (e.g., navbar, main, footer), leading to cleaner UI boundaries.

2. **Parallel Development**
   Multiple teams can work on different UI areas simultaneously without interfering with each other.

3. **Reusable Across Pages**
   Shared sections like headers and footers are reused across multiple routes or modules.

---

#### ⚠️ Challenges:

1. **Tight Coupling to Layout**
   Horizontal splits assume a fixed page structure, which may not scale for dynamic or app-like SPAs.

2. **Shared State Management**
   If components (like cart count in navbar) need data from other MFEs (like product listing), communication becomes tricky.

3. **Styling Conflicts**
   CSS bleed or layout inconsistencies can occur if styles aren’t isolated well.

---

#### 🛠 Best Practices:

* Use **shadow DOM** or **CSS modules** to prevent style conflicts.
* Establish a **design system** or shared library for consistency.
* Use **global event bus** or **custom pub/sub** for inter-microfrontend communication (e.g., updating cart count in navbar).
* Employ **iframe** or **Web Components** if strong isolation is needed.

---

#### 📌 When to Use Horizontal Split?

* When your app has **clearly defined layout zones** (e.g., dashboard with fixed header/sidebar).
* When **UX consistency** is high across all routes.
* When multiple teams maintain **static/shared components** like navbars or footers.
