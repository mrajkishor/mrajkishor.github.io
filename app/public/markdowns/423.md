# ⚙️ `getServerSideProps` in Next.js — Real-Time Data with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js is powerful because it supports **multiple rendering strategies**, and one of the most important among them is **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**. With SSR, you can fetch data **on every request** and deliver **up-to-date HTML** directly from the server.

In Next.js, this is implemented using the special async function `getServerSideProps`.

---

## 🧠 What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

Server-Side Rendering means:
- Data is fetched **on every request**
- HTML is **pre-rendered on the server**
- The browser receives a **fully rendered page**

This is useful when:
- Data is **frequently updated**
- You need **SEO** for dynamic content
- Personalization is required per user/session

---

## 🔧 What is `getServerSideProps`?

`getServerSideProps` is a **Next.js data fetching method** that runs **only on the server**, before rendering a page.

> It runs **on each request**, not at build time.

---

## 📦 Syntax Example

```js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      posts
    }
  };
}
```

And in your component:

```js
export default function Blog({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

---

## 🧰 Parameters of `getServerSideProps`

You can access details of the request via the `context` object:

```js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const {
    params,
    query,
    req,
    res,
    resolvedUrl,
    locale,
    locales,
    defaultLocale
  } = context;
}
```

Useful for:
- Reading **query params**, cookies, headers
- Handling **authentication**, **redirects**, or **user sessions**

---

## 🔐 Example: SSR with Authentication

```js
export async function getServerSideProps({ req }) {
  const token = req.cookies.token;

  if (!token) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/login',
        permanent: false
      }
    };
  }

  return {
    props: { user: { name: "John Doe" } }
  };
}
```

## ⚙️ SSR vs SSG vs CSR

| Feature              | `getServerSideProps` (SSR) | `getStaticProps` (SSG) | Client-Side Fetching |
|----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| When it runs         | On **every request**       | At **build time**       | In the browser        |
| Use Case             | Real-time data, SEO        | Blog posts, docs        | User-specific content |
| Performance          | Slower (per request)       | Fast (pre-rendered)     | Fast (after hydration) |
| SEO Friendly         | ✅ Yes                     | ✅ Yes                  | ❌ No (unless hydrated) |


> Note: In Next.js, ==hydration== is the process of taking server-rendered HTML and making it interactive on the client-side by attaching event listeners and React components, effectively transforming a static page into a dynamic, interactive application

---

## 🔄 Revalidate or Cache?

No. Unlike `getStaticProps`, **you cannot use `revalidate` or ISR** with `getServerSideProps`. It **always re-runs** on every request.

If you want revalidation **without hitting the server every time**, consider switching to:
- `getStaticProps` + `ISR`
- Client-side fetching + cache
- API Routes + SWR

---

## ⚠️ Best Practices

✅ Use SSR only when **absolutely needed**  
✅ Avoid **heavy computations** in `getServerSideProps`  
✅ Keep response times low  
✅ Use SSR for **personalized pages**, **auth-protected routes**, or **SEO-focused dynamic content**  
✅ Use CDN caching when possible

---

## 📁 File-Level Requirement

`getServerSideProps` can **only be used in page components** inside the `pages/` directory.

It **cannot** be used in `_app.js`, `_document.js`, or inside components.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

- E-commerce product page with dynamic price & stock
- User dashboard with real-time notifications
- Personalized homepage (based on cookies/session)
- Admin panel with secure backend validation
- News site with frequently changing articles

## 🚀 Final Thought

`getServerSideProps` gives you **flexibility, power, and real-time rendering** — all while maintaining SEO-friendliness and performance. Use it wisely to deliver personalized, data-driven pages that stay fast and fresh on every request.
