## 📘 **Instruction Formats – Detailed Notes**

### 🔹 What is an Instruction Format?

An **instruction format** defines the **layout (structure)** of bits in a machine instruction. It tells the CPU **how to decode** an instruction — what operation to perform, which registers/memory to use, and where to store the result.

---

### 🔹 Purpose of Instruction Format

- To specify the **operation (opcode)**
- To identify the **source and destination operands**
- To determine the **addressing mode**
- To encode all necessary control info in a fixed or variable size

---

### 🔹 Key Components of an Instruction Format

| Field             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Opcode**        | Operation code (e.g., ADD, MOV) |
| **Operand(s)**    | Registers or memory locations to be used |
| **Address field** | For memory operands |
| **Mode bits**     | Specify addressing mode (e.g., immediate, indirect) |
| **Misc fields**   | May include condition codes, shift bits, etc. |

### 🔹 Types of Instruction Formats

#### 1. **Zero-Address Instruction (Stack-based)**
- No operands in the instruction (operands taken from the stack)
- Example: `ADD` (adds top two values on stack)

#### 2. **One-Address Instruction**
- One operand specified (second implicit, like accumulator)
- Example: `LOAD X` → ACC ← M[X]

#### 3. **Two-Address Instruction**
- Two operands: one destination and one source
- Example: `MOV A, B` → A ← B

#### 4. **Three-Address Instruction**
- Full flexibility with two sources and one destination
- Example: `ADD R1, R2, R3` → R1 ← R2 + R3

#### 5. **Variable-Length Instruction**
- Used in CISC architectures
- Different instructions can have different lengths

#### 6. **Fixed-Length Instruction**
- Used in RISC architectures (e.g., 32-bit always)
- Easier to decode and pipeline

### 🔹 Examples of Instruction Format (32-bit RISC)

| Field     | Size     |
|-----------|----------|
| Opcode    | 6 bits   |
| rs (src1) | 5 bits   |
| rt (src2) | 5 bits   |
| rd (dest) | 5 bits   |
| shamt     | 5 bits   |
| funct     | 6 bits   |

- This format is used in **MIPS** (R-type format)

### 🔹 Importance in GATE and Interviews

- GATE asks questions on **how many bits are required**, or **how instruction is decoded**.
- Interviews (especially for systems/backend) may ask about **instruction-level parallelism** or **pipeline compatibility**.

### 🔹 Summary

| Instruction Format | Pros | Cons |
|--------------------|------|------|
| 0/1-Address        | Compact | Limited flexibility |
| 2-Address          | Balance of size and function | Needs internal registers |
| 3-Address          | Most flexible | Takes more instruction space |
