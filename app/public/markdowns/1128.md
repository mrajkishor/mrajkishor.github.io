Here are the **most commonly asked Java interview questions with clear answers** on **Immutability and Memory Management** â€” especially relevant for **7+ years full stack roles** (Wipro, Infosys, TCS, product companies).

## âœ… **Immutability in Java**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. What is immutability in Java?**

**Answer:**
An object is **immutable** if its **state cannot change** after it is created. In Java, once an immutable object is created, **its fields cannot be modified**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Which Java classes are immutable by default?**

**Answer:**

* `String`
* All wrapper classes: `Integer`, `Float`, `Long`, etc.
* `BigDecimal`, `BigInteger`

These are designed to be thread-safe and consistent across references.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. How do you make a custom class immutable?**

**Answer:**
To make a class immutable:

1. Declare the class as `final` (no subclassing)
2. Make all fields `private` and `final`
3. Do not provide any setters
4. Initialize fields via constructor
5. Return **defensive copies** of mutable objects

**Example:**

```java
public final class Employee {
    private final String name;
    private final Date joiningDate;

    public Employee(String name, Date joiningDate) {
        this.name = name;
        this.joiningDate = new Date(joiningDate.getTime()); // defensive copy
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Date getJoiningDate() {
        return new Date(joiningDate.getTime()); // defensive copy
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Why is immutability important?**

**Answer:**

* **Thread safety** without synchronization
* **Safe sharing** of objects across classes
* Easier to reason about â€” no side effects
* Useful in collections as keys (`HashMap`, `HashSet`)

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Is `String` truly immutable? What happens on `concat()`?**

**Answer:**
Yes, `String` is immutable. When you call `.concat()` or use `+`:

* A **new String object** is created
* The original string remains unchanged

```java
String s1 = "abc";
String s2 = s1.concat("def");

System.out.println(s1); // abc
System.out.println(s2); // abcdef
```

## âœ… **Memory Management in Java**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **6. How does memory management work in Java?**

**Answer:**
Java manages memory **automatically** using:

* **Heap**: For object allocation (new)
* **Stack**: For method calls and local variables
* **Garbage Collector (GC)**: Reclaims unused memory (no explicit `free()`)

---

### ðŸ”¹ **7. What are the main areas of memory in JVM?**

| Area                | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Heap                | Stores objects and class instances       |
| Stack               | Stores method calls, local vars, refs    |
| Metaspace (Java 8+) | Stores class metadata (replaces PermGen) |
| Code Cache          | Stores compiled bytecode (JIT)           |

---

### ðŸ”¹ **8. What is Garbage Collection (GC)?**

**Answer:**
GC is a background process that **automatically frees memory** by removing objects **no longer reachable** from any live thread or static reference.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **9. How does GC determine an object is unreachable?**

**Answer:**
By **reference graph traversal** starting from **GC Roots** (like active threads, static variables, etc.).
If an object can't be reached from GC Roots â†’ it's eligible for garbage collection.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **10. What is `finalize()` method? Is it still used?**

**Answer:**

* `finalize()` was a method that the GC could call before reclaiming an object.
* It was **unreliable and deprecated** since Java 9.
* Use `try-with-resources` or `Cleaner` API instead.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **11. What tools do you use to monitor memory usage in production?**

**Answer:**

* `jvisualvm`
* `jconsole`
* `jstat`, `jmap`, `jhat` (command-line)
* Prometheus + Grafana with JVM exporters
* Java Flight Recorder (JFR) for profiling
