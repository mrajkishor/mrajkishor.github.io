## üßÆ Binary Multiplication

**Binary multiplication** is the method of multiplying numbers represented in binary (base-2). Like decimal multiplication, it involves a **multiplicand**, a **multiplier**, and results in a **product**. However, since binary numbers only use two digits (0 and 1), the rules and operations are greatly simplified.

### ‚úÖ Rules of Binary Multiplication

There are only four possible outcomes for single-bit binary multiplication:

| Multiplicand | Multiplier | Product |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------- |
| 0            | 0          | 0       |
| 0            | 1          | 0       |
| 1            | 0          | 0       |
| 1            | 1          | 1       |

> üìå Note: These rules are equivalent to the logical **AND** operation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Binary Multiplication Procedure

Let‚Äôs multiply two binary numbers:

> (11101)‚ÇÇ √ó (1001)‚ÇÇ
> Decimal equivalents: 29 √ó 9 = 261

#### Step-by-step:

```
          1 1 1 0 1      (Multiplicand: 11101)
  √ó           1 0 0 1    (Multiplier:   1001)
  ---------------------
          1 1 1 0 1      ‚Üê 11101 √ó 1 (LSB)
  0 0 0 0 0             ‚Üê 11101 √ó 0 (shifted one position left)
0 0 0 0 0               ‚Üê 11101 √ó 0 (shifted two positions left)
1 1 1 0 1               ‚Üê 11101 √ó 1 (shifted three positions left)
  ---------------------
1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1      ‚Üê Final sum = (100000101)‚ÇÇ
```

So, **(11101)‚ÇÇ √ó (1001)‚ÇÇ = (100000101)‚ÇÇ**,
which is **261** in decimal.

### üß† Key Concepts

* Each **partial product** is the result of multiplying the multiplicand by one bit of the multiplier.
* For each successive bit to the left in the multiplier, shift the multiplicand one position to the left.
* Finally, **add all the partial products** using binary addition rules.

---

### üìå Binary Multiplication with Fractions

The same process applies even when binary numbers have **fractional parts** (fixed point or floating point), except:

* Count the total number of fractional bits in both operands.
* Perform normal binary multiplication.
* Place the binary point in the product so that it has the same number of fractional bits.

### ‚úÖ Advantages of Binary Multiplication

* **Simpler logic:** Involves only 0s and 1s.
* **Efficient for hardware:** Easier to implement using logic gates.
* **Fast operations:** Particularly when optimized with shift-and-add or array multipliers.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation

* Large binary numbers lead to more **partial products** and hence **require more space and time** unless optimized (e.g., using Booth‚Äôs algorithm, Wallace trees, etc.).
