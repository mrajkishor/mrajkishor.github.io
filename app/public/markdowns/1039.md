## 📘 Algorithms – Sorting

### 🔹 Topic: **Insertion Sort**

## 🔹 1. What is Insertion Sort?

**Insertion Sort** is a simple and intuitive **comparison-based sorting algorithm** that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It is analogous to **sorting playing cards** in your hand.

> At every step, it **inserts** the current element into its **correct position** in the already sorted portion.

---

## 🔹 2. How It Works

1. Consider the first element as sorted
2. Pick the next element and compare it with elements in the sorted portion (left side)
3. Shift all larger elements to the right
4. Insert the element in the correct position
5. Repeat for all elements

---

### ✅ Example:

Given `arr = [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]`

* Start with index `i = 1`, key = 2 → Insert before 5
* Next `i = 2`, key = 4 → Insert before 5
* Next `i = 3`, key = 6 → No change
* Continue… until full array is sorted

🔚 Final: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

## 🔹 3. Python Code

```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]  # Shift right
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key  # Insert at correct position
```

## 🔹 4. Time and Space Complexity

| Case         | Comparisons             | Time Complexity | Swaps/Assignments | Space |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| Best Case    | n − 1 (already sorted)  | O(n)            | O(1) per element  | O(1)  |
| Worst Case   | \~n²/2 (reverse sorted) | O(n²)           | O(n²)             | O(1)  |
| Average Case | \~n²/4                  | O(n²)           | O(n²)             | O(1)  |

✅ In-place
✅ Stable
✅ Adaptive (faster for nearly sorted data)

## 🔹 5. Key Characteristics

| Property       | Value                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| In-place       | ✅ Yes (no extra memory used)        |
| Stable         | ✅ Yes (does not reorder equal keys) |
| Adaptive       | ✅ Yes (O(n) for sorted input)       |
| Recursive Form | ❌ Rarely used                       |
| Preferred When | Array is **small or nearly sorted** |

---

## 🔹 6. Real Use Cases

* Suitable for small datasets
* Used in **hybrid sorts** like Timsort (Python, Java) for small runs
* Educational tool for understanding sorting

## 🔹 7. Comparison With Other O(n²) Sorts

| Feature    | Insertion Sort  | Selection Sort | Bubble Sort |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Best Time  | O(n)            | O(n²)          | O(n)        |
| Worst Time | O(n²)           | O(n²)          | O(n²)       |
| Stable     | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes       |
| Adaptive   | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes       |
| Swaps      | Few (efficient) | Max (n swaps)  | Many        |

| Metric             | Insertion Sort |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Best Case          | O(n)           |
| Worst/Average Case | O(n²)          |
| Space Complexity   | O(1)           |
| In-place           | ✅ Yes          |
| Stable             | ✅ Yes          |
| Adaptive           | ✅ Yes          |

## ✅ Final Tips for GATE

* GATE may ask about **number of comparisons/swaps** or **state of array** after `k` passes
* Best-case complexity **requires sorted input**
* Don’t confuse with selection sort — **insertion sort avoids unnecessary swaps**
* Understand **how inner loop shifts elements**, not just compares
