## üîπ 1. **What is a Heap?**

A **Heap** is a **complete binary tree** that satisfies the **heap property**.

There are two main types:

| Type         | Heap Property                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Min Heap** | Every parent node is **less than or equal to** its children    |
| **Max Heap** | Every parent node is **greater than or equal to** its children |

> ‚úÖ A Heap is **not** a BST ‚Äî values may be unordered across subtrees.

---

## üîπ 2. **Heap as a Complete Binary Tree**

* All levels are **completely filled**, except possibly the last.
* Nodes are filled **left to right** at each level.
* Heaps are often **implemented as arrays** due to this predictable structure.

---

## üîπ 3. **Array Representation of Heap**

A binary heap can be stored in an array where:

* For node at index `i`:

  * **Left child**: at index `2i + 1`
  * **Right child**: at index `2i + 2`
  * **Parent**: at index `‚åä(i - 1)/2‚åã`

### ‚úÖ Example: Min Heap

Array: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 6]`

```
        1
       / \
      3   5
     / \  /
    7  9 6
```

## üîπ 4. **Key Heap Operations**

> GATE DA only requires conceptual understanding ‚Äî not code.

| Operation           | Description                                 | Time Complexity |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Insert(x)**       | Add at bottom, bubble up to restore heap    | O(log n)        |
| **Extract Min/Max** | Remove root, replace with last, bubble down | O(log n)        |
| **Peek**            | Return root (min or max)                    | O(1)            |
| **Heapify**         | Build heap from unordered array             | O(n)            |

---

## üîπ 5. **Min Heap vs Max Heap**

| Property        | Min Heap                 | Max Heap              |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Root node       | Smallest value           | Largest value         |
| Use case        | Priority Queue, Dijkstra | Heapsort (descending) |
| Structure       | Complete Binary Tree     | Same                  |
| Traversal order | Not sorted               | Not sorted            |

---

## üîπ 6. **Use Cases of Heap (GATE-relevant)**

| Application              | Purpose                       | Heap Type                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Priority Queue**       | Serve highest/lowest priority | Min / Max                |
| **Heapsort**             | Efficient sorting             | Max Heap (for ascending) |
| **Dijkstra's Algorithm** | Find shortest path            | Min Heap                 |
| **Kth Smallest/Largest** | Selection problems            | Min/Max Heap             |

---

## üîπ 7. **Heapsort Overview (Concept Only)**

1. Convert array to **Max Heap**
2. Repeatedly:

   * Swap root with last element
   * Reduce heap size
   * Re-heapify from root

> Time complexity: **O(n log n)**
> In-place and comparison-based.

## üîπ 8. **Common GATE-Level Conceptual Questions**

### ‚úÖ Q1: What is the minimum number of comparisons to maintain heap property during insertion?

**Answer:** O(log n) ‚Äî in worst case, we bubble up the node through log(n) levels.

---

### ‚úÖ Q2: Which data structure best supports a priority queue?

**Answer:** Heap (Min Heap for min-priority queue, Max Heap for max-priority)

---

### ‚úÖ Q3: Can a Heap be used to implement a Binary Search Tree?

**Answer:** ‚ùå No. Heaps do **not** guarantee in-order property.
