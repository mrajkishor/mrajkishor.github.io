### 🔍 `super(props);` in Class-Based Components – Explained

---

#### 🔹 Where is it used?

In a React class component:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // now this.props is available
  }
}
```

---

#### 🔹 What does `super(props)` do?

1. `super()` calls the **constructor of the parent class** (`React.Component`).
2. `super(props)` also **passes the `props`** to the parent constructor, so that `this.props` is available inside your constructor.

---

#### 🔹 Why is it required?

In JavaScript, you must call `super()` **before accessing `this`** in a subclass (`constructor` of a class that extends another).

> ⚠️ If you try to access `this.props` before calling `super(props)`, you'll get an error:

```
ReferenceError: Must call super constructor before accessing 'this'
```

---

#### 🔹 Without `super(props)`

```jsx
constructor(props) {
  super();         // ⛔ this.props is undefined here
  console.log(this.props); // undefined
}
```

#### ✅ With `super(props)`

```jsx
constructor(props) {
  super(props);    // ✅ initializes parent class with props
  console.log(this.props); // works as expected
}
```

### 🔚 Summary

> `super(props)` is used in class components to **correctly initialize the parent (`React.Component`) constructor with props**, enabling you to access `this.props` inside the constructor.

### Visual diagram

Here’s a **visual diagram** of the **inheritance and constructor chain** for `super(props)` in a React class component:

---

### 🔗 Inheritance Flow with `super(props)`

```plaintext
React.Component
      ▲
      │  (constructor(props) inside React.Component)
      │
MyComponent (extends React.Component)
      │
      ├─ constructor(props) {
      │     super(props);   ← invokes React.Component's constructor
      │     this.props ✅    ← now accessible
      │   }
```

---

### 🧠 Internal Flow Step-by-Step

1. `MyComponent` extends `React.Component`.
2. In `MyComponent`'s `constructor(props)`:

   * `super(props)` calls the parent `React.Component` constructor with `props`.
   * React sets `this.props = props` inside `React.Component`.
3. After `super(props)`, you can safely use `this.props` in your constructor and methods.

---

### ❌ What Happens Without `super(props)`

```plaintext
constructor(props) {
  // ❌ this.props is not yet initialized
  console.log(this.props); // ❌ ReferenceError
}
```

You **must call `super()` before using `this`**, or JavaScript throws a runtime error.

---

### Simple JavaScript example

Here's a **simple JavaScript example** showing how `super(props)` works in **plain ES6 classes**, without React:

---

### ✅ Example: `super(props)` in JavaScript Classes

```js
class Parent {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    console.log("Parent constructor:", this.name);
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  constructor(name, age) {
    super(name); // calls Parent constructor with 'name'
    this.age = age;
    console.log("Child constructor:", this.name, this.age);
  }
}

const c = new Child("Alice", 25);
```

---

### 🔍 Output:

```
Parent constructor: Alice
Child constructor: Alice 25
```

---

### 🧠 What's Happening:

1. `Child` extends `Parent`
2. In `Child`’s constructor:

   * `super(name)` calls `Parent`’s constructor, which sets `this.name = name`
3. After that, `this.age = age` runs
4. Now both `this.name` and `this.age` are set in the `Child` instance

---

### ❌ If you omit `super(name)`:

```js
class Child extends Parent {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.age = age; // ❌ Error: Must call super constructor before using 'this'
  }
}
```

> 🔴 JavaScript will throw:
> **`ReferenceError: Must call super constructor before accessing 'this' in a derived class constructor`**

---

### ✅ Summary:

> In plain JavaScript, `super()` must be called in a subclass constructor **before** accessing `this`, because it initializes the parent class and makes `this` usable.
