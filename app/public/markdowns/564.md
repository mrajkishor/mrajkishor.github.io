# 🗂️ Express.js Project Structure: Best Practices for Scalable Applications

When starting with Express.js, it's tempting to write all your logic in a single file (`app.js` or `server.js`). While this might work for small prototypes, it quickly becomes unmanageable as your application grows. A well-organized **project structure** improves readability, simplifies maintenance, and supports scalability — making it a key Express.js best practice.

---

## 🧠 Why Does Project Structure Matter?

A good project structure helps you:

* Maintain **separation of concerns**
* Enable **modular** development
* Facilitate **unit testing**
* Simplify **collaboration** across teams
* Make onboarding **faster** for new developers

## 📦 Recommended Express.js Folder Structure

Here’s a standard, scalable structure used in many production-grade applications:

```
project-root/
│
├── src/
│   ├── config/             # Environment-specific configs (db, server)
│   ├── controllers/        # Route handler logic
│   ├── middleware/         # Custom middleware functions
│   ├── models/             # Database models or schemas
│   ├── routes/             # Route definitions
│   ├── services/           # Business logic and reusable utilities
│   ├── utils/              # Helper functions
│   └── app.js              # Initializes express, middleware, routes
│
├── tests/                  # Unit and integration tests
├── .env                    # Environment variables
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── server.js               # Entry point, connects to DB, starts server
```

---

## 🔍 Folder Breakdown

### ✅ `server.js`

* Entry point
* Loads environment config
* Starts the server

```js
const app = require('./src/app');
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

---

### ✅ `src/app.js`

* Initializes Express app
* Sets up middleware and routes

```js
const express = require('express');
const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');
const errorHandler = require('./middleware/errorHandler');

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
app.use(errorHandler);

module.exports = app;
```

---

### ✅ `routes/`

* Defines route groups (e.g., `userRoutes.js`, `productRoutes.js`)

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const userController = require('../controllers/userController');

router.get('/', userController.getAllUsers);
router.post('/', userController.createUser);

module.exports = router;
```

---

### ✅ `controllers/`

* Contains logic to handle requests

```js
exports.getAllUsers = (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of users');
};
```

---

### ✅ `middleware/`

* Custom middleware (e.g., auth, logging, error handling)

---

### ✅ `models/`

* Define database schemas (e.g., Mongoose, Sequelize)

---

### ✅ `services/`

* Holds reusable business logic and service wrappers

---

### ✅ `config/`

* Environment config, database connection settings

---

### ✅ `utils/`

* Utility functions like date formatting, token generation, etc.

## 🛡️ Best Practices

| Practice                         | Benefit                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Separate logic by responsibility | Easier to test, read, and maintain        |
| Keep `server.js` thin            | Only handle startup, keep logic elsewhere |
| Use `src/` to encapsulate source | Avoid clutter in root directory           |
| Use meaningful naming            | Self-documenting structure                |
| Avoid deeply nested folders      | Keep it simple and intuitive              |

## 📁 Project Structure for a Real-world App

```
ecommerce-api/

├── src/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── middleware/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── services/

```

> Add `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, and `.prettierrc` as needed for production readiness.

## ✅ Summary

A clean, modular **project structure** sets the foundation for long-term scalability and productivity in Express.js applications. Whether you're working solo or in a team, structuring your app properly ensures that adding new features or fixing bugs remains manageable over time.
