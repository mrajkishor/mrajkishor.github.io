# 🧪 Integration Testing with Cypress in Next.js

## 🧭 Introduction

Unit tests validate isolated components, but they don’t guarantee that different parts of your app work well together. This is where **integration testing** shines — verifying that components, pages, routes, and APIs all work together in real-world scenarios.

**Cypress** is one of the most popular tools for integration (and end-to-end) testing in modern web apps. It runs directly in the browser, offering a fast and visual way to ensure your Next.js app behaves as expected.

## 🚀 What is Cypress?

Cypress is a **JavaScript-based test runner** that lets you write UI tests to simulate user behavior. Unlike traditional browser automation tools (like Selenium), Cypress runs inside the browser, making it:

- ⚡ Fast and stable
- 🧩 Easy to debug with DevTools
- 🧪 Great for integration and E2E tests

---

## 🔧 Installing Cypress

Install Cypress as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev cypress
```

Add a script to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "cypress": "cypress open"
}
```

Launch the Cypress UI:

```bash
npm run cypress
```

---

## 🗂 Directory Structure

After launching once, Cypress creates this folder:

```
cypress/
├── e2e/
│   └── myTest.cy.js
├── support/
│   └── e2e.js
├── fixtures/
├── downloads/
```

## 🧪 Writing Your First Integration Test

### Example: Testing a login form

**File: `cypress/e2e/login.cy.js`**

```js
describe('Login Flow', () => {
  it('should log in the user', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/login');

    cy.get('input[name=email]').type('test@example.com');
    cy.get('input[name=password]').type('password123');
    cy.get('button[type=submit]').click();

    // Assert user is redirected to dashboard
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
    cy.contains('Welcome, test@example.com');
  });
});
```

## 🧩 Testing Integration Points

Integration testing checks interactions between components:

| Example Scenario                          | What It Tests                                |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Form Submission → API Route → Redirect    | Form + API + Routing work together            |
| Navbar Links → Page Load                  | Navigation + Page Rendering                   |
| Authenticated User → Protected Route      | Login + JWT Token + Page Guard Logic          |

## 🔍 Useful Cypress Commands

| Command                | Description                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `cy.visit(url)`        | Visit a page                          |
| `cy.get(selector)`     | Query DOM elements                    |
| `cy.type(value)`       | Type into an input                    |
| `cy.click()`           | Simulate a button click               |
| `cy.url()`             | Get current page URL                  |
| `cy.contains(text)`    | Assert text exists                    |

## 🔐 Testing Authenticated Sessions

You can simulate login by setting a cookie or token before visiting a protected page:

```js
cy.setCookie('token', 'mock-jwt-token');
cy.visit('/dashboard');
```

Or log in via UI and preserve cookies between tests:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.session('login', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('input[name=email]').type('admin@test.com');
    cy.get('input[name=password]').type('password123');
    cy.get('button[type=submit]').click();
  });
});
```

---

## 📈 Running Tests in CI

Use `cypress run` for headless mode (CI/CD):

```bash
npx cypress run
```

You can also integrate Cypress with GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Vercel pipelines for automatic testing on push.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Group related tests in `.cy.js` files
- Test realistic user flows (navigation, form, API)
- Use `cy.intercept()` to stub API responses if needed
- Avoid flaky tests by adding `cy.wait()` cautiously or using route-based waits

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Integration testing with Cypress helps you catch bugs that unit tests miss — broken user flows, misconfigured routes, API mismatches, etc. In Next.js projects, Cypress fits perfectly to validate everything from routing to authentication.

> If unit tests are the building blocks, integration tests are the structure test — don’t ship without them.
