###  Johnson’s Algorithm

---

## 🚀 Introduction

**Johnson’s Algorithm** is an advanced shortest path algorithm used to find the **shortest path between every pair of vertices** in a **weighted directed graph**, including graphs with **negative edge weights** (but **no negative cycles**).

It combines the power of:

* **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** (to handle negative weights and reweight the graph)
* **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** (for fast single-source shortest path computation)

---

## 🧠 Motivation

**Why not use Floyd-Warshall?**

* Floyd-Warshall: `O(V³)` — great for small graphs.
* Johnson’s Algorithm: `O(V² log V + VE)` — more efficient for **sparse graphs** (where E ≪ V²).

## ✅ When to Use

| Situation                                | Johnson’s Algorithm |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Graph has negative weights               | ✅ Yes               |
| Graph has negative **cycles**            | ❌ No (detects them) |
| Sparse Graph (E ≪ V²)                    | ✅ Efficient         |
| Need shortest paths between all vertices | ✅ Yes               |

## 📚 Step-by-Step Algorithm

Let `G = (V, E)` be the input graph.

---

### **Step 1: Add Dummy Node**

Add a **new vertex `q`** connected to every vertex `v ∈ V` with edge weight `0`.

This ensures that all vertices become reachable for reweighting.

---

### **Step 2: Run Bellman-Ford from `q`**

Use Bellman-Ford to compute shortest distances `h[v]` from `q` to every other vertex `v`.

* If a **negative cycle** exists: **terminate** — Johnson’s algorithm cannot proceed.

$$
h[v] = \text{Shortest distance from } q \text{ to } v
$$

---

### **Step 3: Reweight Edges**

Transform edge weights to eliminate negatives:

$$
w'(u, v) = w(u, v) + h[u] - h[v]
$$

✅ Now all `w'(u, v)` ≥ 0 — enabling safe use of **Dijkstra**.

---

### **Step 4: Run Dijkstra for Each Vertex**

Run Dijkstra from each vertex `u ∈ V` using `w'` as weights:

* Get shortest distances `d'[u][v]`

---

### **Step 5: Reverse Reweighting**

Restore original distances using:

$$
d[u][v] = d'[u][v] + h[v] - h[u]
$$

These are now the correct all-pairs shortest distances in the **original graph** (even with negative weights).

---

## 🧠 Intuition Behind Reweighting

* Bellman-Ford gives us a potential `h[v]` for each vertex.
* Reweighting ensures **non-negative** edge weights without changing actual shortest paths.
* This enables using fast **greedy** Dijkstra on each node.

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Operation          | Complexity                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Bellman-Ford       | O(VE)                                |
| Dijkstra (V times) | O(V \* (E + V log V)) using min-heap |
| Total Time         | **O(V² log V + VE)**                 |
| Space              | O(V²) for distance matrix            |

> Johnson is faster than Floyd–Warshall for **sparse graphs**.

## 🔁 Example

**Graph:**

```
0 → 1 (3)
0 → 2 (-2)
1 → 2 (1)
2 → 0 (4)
```

### 1️⃣ Add Dummy Node `q → {0,1,2}` with weight 0

Run Bellman-Ford from `q` → get `h[] = [0, 0, -2]`

### 2️⃣ Reweight edges:

```
w'(0 → 1) = 3 + 0 - 0 = 3
w'(0 → 2) = -2 + 0 - (-2) = 0
w'(1 → 2) = 1 + 0 - (-2) = 3
w'(2 → 0) = 4 -2 - 0 = 2
```

Now all edges ≥ 0 ✅

### 3️⃣ Run Dijkstra from each node using reweighted graph

### 4️⃣ Reverse reweighting to get actual distances.
