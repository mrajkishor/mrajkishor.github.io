### **Subqueries and Nested Queries in Advanced SQL**

Subqueries and nested queries are advanced SQL techniques that allow you to perform complex data retrieval by embedding one query within another. These techniques enable dynamic and multi-layered querying, making it easier to handle intricate data relationships and computations.

This blog will cover:
- What are subqueries?
- Types of subqueries.
- Practical examples of subqueries and nested queries.
- Best practices for writing subqueries.

### **What is a Subquery?**

A **subquery** (also called an inner query or nested query) is a query that is embedded inside another SQL query. The outer query uses the result of the subquery to perform further operations.

#### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name (operator)
      (SELECT column_name FROM another_table WHERE condition);
```

#### **Components:**
1. **Outer Query**: The main query that uses the result of the subquery.
2. **Inner Query**: The query embedded within the outer query.

### **Types of Subqueries**

#### **1. Single-Row Subquery**
Returns only one row of data.
- Used with operators like `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `<>`.

#### **Example:**
Find employees who earn more than the average salary.
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

#### **2. Multi-Row Subquery**
Returns multiple rows of data.
- Used with operators like `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`.

#### **Example:**
Find employees who work in departments with IDs 101 or 102.
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentID IN (101, 102));
```

#### **3. Correlated Subquery**
A correlated subquery is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query. It depends on values from the outer query.

#### **Example:**
Find employees whose salaries are greater than the average salary of their department.
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Salary, DepartmentID
FROM Employees e1
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary)
                FROM Employees e2
                WHERE e1.DepartmentID = e2.DepartmentID);
```

#### **4. Nested Subqueries**
A subquery within another subquery.

#### **Example:**
Find employees who work in the largest department (by the number of employees).
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = (SELECT DepartmentID
                      FROM (SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
                            FROM Employees
                            GROUP BY DepartmentID
                            ORDER BY EmployeeCount DESC
                            LIMIT 1) LargestDept);
```

### **Examples of Subqueries**

#### **1. Subquery in `SELECT` Clause**
Use a subquery to calculate a derived column.

**Example:** Calculate the total revenue generated by each product.
```sql
SELECT ProductID, Name,
       (SELECT SUM(Quantity * Price) FROM Sales WHERE Sales.ProductID = Products.ProductID) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Products;
```

#### **2. Subquery in `FROM` Clause**
Use a subquery as a derived table.

**Example:** Find the top-performing departments by revenue.
```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, TotalRevenue
FROM (SELECT DepartmentID, SUM(Salary) AS TotalRevenue
      FROM Employees
      GROUP BY DepartmentID) DepartmentRevenue
WHERE TotalRevenue > 50000;
```

#### **3. Subquery with `EXISTS` Operator**
Check if a row exists in another table.

**Example:** Find employees who have made sales.
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name
FROM Employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Sales s WHERE s.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID);
```

#### **4. Subquery with `NOT EXISTS`**
Check if a row does not exist in another table.

**Example:** Find products that have never been sold.
```sql
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Products p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Sales s WHERE s.ProductID = p.ProductID);
```

### **Correlated Subquery in Action**

#### **Example:** Find employees earning more than the average salary in their department.
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Salary, DepartmentID
FROM Employees e1
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary)
                FROM Employees e2
                WHERE e1.DepartmentID = e2.DepartmentID);
```

**Explanation:**
- The inner query calculates the average salary for each department.
- The outer query compares each employeeâ€™s salary with the average salary of their department.

### **Nested Subqueries in Action**

#### **Example:** Find the product with the highest total sales.
```sql
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = (SELECT ProductID
                   FROM (SELECT ProductID, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
                         FROM Sales
                         GROUP BY ProductID
                         ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC
                         LIMIT 1) TopProduct);
```

**Explanation:**
1. The innermost query calculates the total quantity sold for each product.
2. The middle query orders products by total quantity and selects the top product.
3. The outer query retrieves the product details.

### **Best Practices for Writing Subqueries**

1. **Optimize for Performance:**
   - Avoid unnecessary subqueries when a `JOIN` can achieve the same result more efficiently.
   - Use indexed columns in subquery conditions.

2. **Test Incrementally:**
   - Break down complex queries into smaller parts and test each subquery individually.

3. **Use Aliases:**
   - Assign meaningful aliases to subqueries for clarity.
   ```sql
   SELECT e.Name, d.TotalSalary
   FROM Employees e,
        (SELECT DepartmentID, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
         FROM Employees
         GROUP BY DepartmentID) d
   WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
   ```

4. **Avoid Over-Nesting:**
   - Too many levels of nesting can make queries hard to read and maintain. Simplify where possible.

5. **Use `EXISTS` for Better Readability:**
   - When checking for the existence of rows, `EXISTS` often performs better than `IN` for large datasets.

### **Conclusion**

Subqueries and nested queries are powerful tools in SQL that enable advanced data analysis and complex query building. By understanding how to use single-row, multi-row, correlated, and nested subqueries, you can tackle intricate data requirements efficiently. Practice these techniques on sample datasets to build proficiency and enhance your SQL skills.
