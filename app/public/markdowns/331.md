The LeetCode problem **[135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)** is a **==greedy algorithm==** problem that requires distributing candies to children based on their ratings while minimizing the total candies given.

---

## **Problem Statement**
- There are `n` children standing in a line, each with a **rating** given in an integer array `ratings[]`.
- You must **give each child at least one candy**.
- A child with a **higher rating than their adjacent child must get more candies** than them.
- Find the **minimum number of candies** required to satisfy these conditions.

---

## **Key Observations**
1. If we only look at **one direction** (left to right or right to left), we might miss some constraints.
2. To satisfy both **left and right neighbors**, we need a **==two-pass greedy approach==**.

---

## **Optimal Greedy Approach**
1. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
   - Ensure that if `ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]`, then `candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1`.
   - This guarantees increasing ratings get more candies in this direction.

2. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
   - Ensure that if `ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]`, then `candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i+1] + 1)`.
   - This guarantees decreasing ratings also get the correct number of candies in this direction.

3. **Sum all the candies** to get the minimum required candies.

## **Time Complexity**
- **O(n)** (Two passes over `n` children)
- **O(n) space** (for `candies[]` array)

---

## **Java Solution**
```java
public class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] candies = new int[n];

        // Step 1: Assign at least 1 candy to each child
        Arrays.fill(candies, 1);

        // Step 2: Left to Right Pass
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Right to Left Pass
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Sum up all candies
        int totalCandies = 0;
        for (int c : candies) {
            totalCandies += c;
        }
        
        return totalCandies;
    }
}
```

## **Example Walkthrough**
### **Input**
```plaintext
ratings = [1, 0, 2]
```

### **Steps**
1. **Initialize candies array** (all `1` initially):
   ```plaintext
   candies = [1, 1, 1]
   ```

2. **Left-to-Right Pass**
   - `ratings[1] < ratings[0]`, no change.
   - `ratings[2] > ratings[1]`, so `candies[2] = candies[1] + 1 = 2`.
   ```plaintext
   candies = [1, 1, 2]
   ```

3. **Right-to-Left Pass**
   - `ratings[1] < ratings[2]`, no change.
   - `ratings[0] > ratings[1]`, so `candies[0] = max(1, candies[1] + 1) = 2`.
   ```plaintext
   candies = [2, 1, 2]
   ```

4. **Total Candies**
   ```plaintext
   2 + 1 + 2 = 5
   ```

### **Output**
```plaintext
5
```

## **Summary**
- **Two-pass greedy approach** (Left-to-Right + Right-to-Left).
- **O(n) time complexity**.
- **O(n) extra space**.
- Ensures **both left and right constraints** are met while keeping candies minimal.
