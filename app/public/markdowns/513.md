# 🚀 Lazy Loading and Code Splitting in Next.js

## 🧭 Introduction

Modern web apps need to be **fast, interactive, and efficient**. Two essential techniques to achieve this are **lazy loading** and **code splitting**. They reduce the initial load time of a page by loading only what's needed, when it's needed — improving **performance**, **SEO**, and **user experience**.

Next.js, being a performance-first framework, supports both strategies **out of the box**.

## 🔍 What is Code Splitting?

**Code Splitting** is the practice of splitting your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks. Instead of shipping one large file, the browser loads code on demand.

### ✅ Benefits:
- Faster page load time
- Reduced memory usage
- Better Time to Interactive (TTI)

---

### 🔧 How Next.js Does Code Splitting Automatically

- **Each page in `pages/` becomes a separate JS chunk**
- Common dependencies are moved into shared chunks
- Only the JavaScript needed for the current route is loaded

#### Example:

```bash
pages/
├── index.js       → Loads only index.js + shared deps
├── about.js       → Loads only about.js when navigated
```

---

## 💤 What is Lazy Loading?

**Lazy loading** delays loading a component, image, or data until it's actually needed — e.g., when it enters the viewport or is clicked.

---

## 🎯 Lazy Loading Components in Next.js

Use Next.js's built-in `next/dynamic` for component-level lazy loading.

```js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
  ssr: false,
});

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Page with Lazy Loaded Component</h1>
      <HeavyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> ✅ `ssr: false` disables server-side rendering for that component  
> ✅ `loading` shows a fallback during load

---

## 🎨 Lazy Loading Images

Next.js's `<Image>` component supports lazy loading by default:

```js
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/images/banner.jpg"
  alt="Banner"
  width={1200}
  height={500}
/>
```

> ✅ Images are **loaded only when in viewport**, using native `loading="lazy"` under the hood

---

## 📚 Lazy Loading Routes (Optional)

Although Next.js handles page-based code splitting automatically, you can manually create dynamic imports to load entire sections or route-based logic lazily using `next/dynamic`.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- ✅ Use `next/dynamic` for large components used conditionally
- ✅ Keep shared dependencies small to avoid bundle bloat
- ✅ Monitor with tools like `next build` and `next devtools`
- ✅ Lazy load third-party scripts and widgets (e.g., chat, analytics)

---

## 🛠️ Tooling Insight

Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then open `.next/analyze/client.html` if using `@next/bundle-analyzer` to visualize your chunks and optimize bundle size.

## 🔄 Summary

| Technique       | Purpose                             | Example Tool        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Code Splitting   | Load only what's needed per route    | Auto by Next.js     |
| Lazy Component   | Delay rendering of heavy components  | `next/dynamic`      |
| Lazy Image       | Avoid loading offscreen images       | `next/image`        |

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Lazy loading and code splitting are **core strategies** for fast, modern apps. Next.js abstracts much of the complexity, giving developers powerful performance tools by default — while still allowing full control.

> Build faster, smarter, and scale effortlessly — that’s the power of Next.js.

__A complete page demoing dynamic component imports, image lazy loading, and route-level code splitting.__


Here’s a **complete Next.js demo page** showcasing:

- ✅ Dynamic component import (lazy loading a heavy component)
- ✅ Lazy loaded image using `next/image`
- ✅ Page-level code splitting (automatically handled by Next.js)

---

### 📁 File: `components/HeavyComponent.js`

```jsx
export default function HeavyComponent() {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '2rem', background: '#eee', marginTop: '2rem' }}>
      <h2>🧱 This is a heavy component!</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine this being a chart, a large table, or a map loaded only when needed.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### 📁 File: `pages/lazy-demo.js`

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
import Image from 'next/image';
import { useState } from 'react';

// Lazy load the heavy component
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <p>Loading heavy component...</p>,
});

export default function LazyDemoPage() {
  const [showHeavy, setShowHeavy] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: 800, margin: 'auto', padding: '2rem' }}>
      <h1>⚡ Lazy Loading and Code Splitting Demo</h1>

      <h2>🖼️ Lazy Loaded Image</h2>
      <Image
        src="/images/hero.jpg"
        alt="Hero image"
        width={800}
        height={400}
        placeholder="blur"
        blurDataURL="/images/hero-blur.jpg"
        style={{ borderRadius: '10px', marginBottom: '2rem' }}
      />

      <h2>🧱 Lazy Loaded Component</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setShowHeavy(true)} style={{ padding: '10px 20px' }}>
        Load Heavy Component
      </button>

      {showHeavy && <HeavyComponent />}
    </div>
  );
}
```
