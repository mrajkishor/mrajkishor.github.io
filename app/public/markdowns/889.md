### üü¢ 1.1 Set and Proposition: Basics

---

### üîπ What is a Set?

A **set** is simply a **collection of distinct objects** ‚Äî all of the **same kind or class**.
Each item in a set is called an **element** or **member** of the set.

üìå **Examples** of sets:

* A set of rivers in India
* A set of vowels: {a, e, i, o, u}
* A set of prime numbers less than 10: {2, 3, 5, 7}

üß† **Notation**:

* Sets are usually named with **capital letters** like A, B, C
* Elements are written in **lowercase** like a, b, x, y

üëâ If `a` is an element of set A, we write:
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ`a ‚àà A` (read as "a belongs to A")

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Ways to Represent Sets

There are **two main methods**:

---

#### a) **Roster Form (Tabular Form)**

* List out each element of the set **inside curly braces**, separated by commas.
* Order doesn't matter, and repetition is not allowed.

üßæ **Example**:
Let A = the set of odd numbers less than 10
Then: `A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}`

---

#### b) **Set Builder Form**

* Describe the **property** shared by all elements.
* General form:

  $$
  \text{Set} = \{ x \, : \, x \text{ satisfies a property} \}
  $$

üßæ **Example**:
Let B = {2, 4, 8, 16, 32}
Then:

$$
B = \{ x \, : \, x = 2^n, \, \text{where } n \in \mathbb{N}, \, 1 \leq n \leq 5 \}
$$

---

### üî¢ Cardinality of a Set

**Cardinality** means the **number of unique elements** in a set.

üßæ **Example**:
Let P = {k, l, m, n}
Then, the **cardinality of P** is:

$$
|P| = 4
$$

If a set has **infinitely many elements**, it's called **countably infinite**.

## üìò Chapter 1.2: Finite and Infinite Sets

### ‚ú® Types of Sets

Sets can be classified in many ways. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the most common types:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Finite Sets

A **finite set** has a **specific number of elements**, say *n*.
This number *n* is called the **cardinality** of the set.

üìå Notation:

* `|A|` or `n(A)` or `#A` ‚Üí number of elements in set A

üßæ **Examples**:

* `A = {1, 2, 3}` ‚Üí |A| = 3
* The **empty set** ‚àÖ has cardinality 0 ‚Üí `|‚àÖ| = 0`
* `{even positive integers}` ‚Üí ‚ùå Not finite (it's infinite)

A set is finite **if there‚Äôs a one-to-one match with natural numbers up to n**.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Infinite Sets

An **infinite set** has no end ‚Äî the elements go on forever.

üîπ **Countably Infinite** (Denumerable):
If a set‚Äôs elements can be paired with **natural numbers**, it‚Äôs countably infinite.

üßæ Example:

* Set of all even numbers: {2, 4, 6, 8, ‚Ä¶}

üîπ **Uncountably Infinite**:
A set that **cannot** be matched with natural numbers.

üßæ Example:

* Set of real numbers between 0 and 1
  ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ`R = {0.a‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇa‚ÇÉ‚Ä¶ | 0 ‚â§ a·µ¢ ‚â§ 9}`

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Subsets

If **every element of A** is also in **B**, we say A is a **subset** of B:

$$
A \subseteq B
$$

üìå If A is a subset of B, then B is the **superset** of A.

üßæ Example:
A = {1, 2}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4} ‚áí A ‚äÜ B

---

### üìå Properties of Subsets

1. Every set is a subset of itself
2. ‚àÖ is a subset of every set
3. If A ‚äÜ B and B ‚äÜ C, then A ‚äÜ C
4. A set with *n* elements has **2‚Åø subsets**

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Proper Subset

A **proper subset** is a subset that‚Äôs **not equal to the original set**:

$$
A \subset B \quad \text{and} \quad A \neq B
$$

üßæ Example:
A = {1, 2}, B = {1, 2, 3} ‚áí A is a **proper** subset of B

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Improper Subset

If A = B, then A is an **improper subset** of B.
Every set is an improper subset of itself.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Universal Set

A **universal set** (U) contains **all elements** under consideration.
Every other set in the context is a subset of this.

üßæ Example:
For population study, U = set of all people in the world

---

### ‚úÖ 7. Null Set (‚àÖ)

A **null set** has **no elements**.

üßæ Example:
Set of natural numbers less than 0 = ‚àÖ

---

### ‚úÖ 8. Singleton Set

A **singleton set** has **only one element**.

üßæ Example:
S = {8} is a singleton

---

### ‚úÖ 9. Equal Sets

Two sets A and B are **equal** if they have **exactly the same elements**.

$$
A = B \iff \forall x, x \in A \Leftrightarrow x \in B
$$

---

### ‚úÖ 10. Equivalent Sets

Two sets are **equivalent** if they have the **same number of elements**, regardless of content.

üßæ Example:
A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {10, 20, 30} ‚Üí A and B are **equivalent**, but **not equal**

---

### ‚úÖ 11. Disjoint Sets

Two sets are **disjoint** if they have **no elements in common**.

üßæ Example:
R = {a, b}, S = {x, y} ‚áí R and S are disjoint

---

### ‚úÖ 12. Power Set

The **power set** of A, written **P(A)**, is the set of **all subsets** of A.

* If A has **n elements**, then P(A) has **2‚Åø subsets**

üßæ Example:
A = {1, 2}
P(A) = {‚àÖ, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}
‚Üí |P(A)| = 4 = 2¬≤

---

### **1.3 Combinations of Sets (Set Operations)**

When we work with sets, we often need to combine them or compare them in different ways. These actions are called **set operations**. The most common ones include: union, intersection, difference, complement, and Cartesian product.

---

#### **1. Union of Sets**

The **union** of two sets A and B is a new set that contains **all elements** from A, from B, or from both. It‚Äôs written as **A ‚à™ B**.

* **Definition**:
  A ‚à™ B = {x | x ‚àà A **or** x ‚àà B}

* **Example**:
  Let A = {10, 11, 12, 13} and B = {13, 14, 15}
  Then, A ‚à™ B = {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
  *(Note: repeated elements are written only once in sets.)*

---

#### **2. Intersection of Sets**

The **intersection** of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are **common** to both A and B. It is denoted by **A ‚à© B**.

* **Definition**:
  A ‚à© B = {x | x ‚àà A **and** x ‚àà B}

* **Example**:
  A = {11, 12, 13} and B = {13, 14, 15}
  A ‚à© B = {13}

---

#### **3. Difference of Sets (Relative Complement)**

The **difference** of sets A and B (written A ‚Äì B) is the set of elements that are in A but **not** in B. Note: A ‚Äì B ‚â† B ‚Äì A.

* **Definition**:
  A ‚Äì B = {x | x ‚àà A **and** x ‚àâ B}

* **Example**:
  A = {10, 11, 12, 13} and B = {13, 14, 15}
  A ‚Äì B = {10, 11, 12}
  B ‚Äì A = {14, 15}

---

#### **4. Complement of a Set**

The **complement** of a set A (written A‚Ä≤ or A<sup>c</sup>) includes all the elements that are in the **universal set U** but **not** in A.

* **Definition**:
  A‚Ä≤ = U ‚Äì A = {x | x ‚àà U and x ‚àâ A}

* **Example**:
  If A = {x | x is an odd number}, then
  A‚Ä≤ = {x | x is not an odd number}
  \= all even numbers or other types, depending on U

---

#### **5. Cartesian Product (Cross Product)**

The **Cartesian product** of two sets A and B, written **A √ó B**, is the set of all possible **ordered pairs (a, b)** where a is from A and b is from B.

* **Definition**:
  A √ó B = {(a, b) | a ‚àà A, b ‚àà B}

* **Example**:
  A = {a, b} and B = {1, 2}
  A √ó B = {(a,1), (a,2), (b,1), (b,2)}
  B √ó A = {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)}
  *(Order matters in Cartesian product)*

---

#### **6. Power Set**

The **power set** of a set A is the set of **all possible subsets** of A, including the empty set and A itself. It is denoted by **P(A)**.

* **If A has n elements**, then P(A) has **2‚Åø** elements.

* **Example**:
  A = {1, 2, 3}
  P(A) = {‚àÖ, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}}
  So, |P(A)| = 2¬≥ = 8

---

#### **7. Partition of a Set**

A **partition** of a set is a way to break it into smaller non-overlapping subsets, such that:

1. **None of the subsets is empty**
2. **All the subsets together make up the entire original set**
3. **No element is repeated across subsets**

* **Example**:
  If S = {a, b, c, d, e, f},
  A valid partition could be: {a, b}, {c}, {d, e, f}
  Another valid one: {a}, {b, c}, {d, e, f}

---

### **1.4 Multisets**

In regular sets, each element appears only once. But in real life, sometimes we need to allow repetition ‚Äî that‚Äôs where **multisets** come in.

A **multiset** is just like a set, except **elements can appear more than once**. The number of times an element appears is called its **multiplicity**.

---

#### **What is a Multiset?**

Think of a multiset as a bag of items where some items might appear again and again ‚Äî and that‚Äôs totally okay.

* **Example 1**: A = {l, l, m, m, n, n, n, n}
  Here,

  * l appears 2 times
  * m appears 2 times
  * n appears 4 times

* **Example 2**: B = {a, a, a, a, a, c}
  So,

  * a appears 5 times
  * c appears once

---

### **Operations on Multisets**

#### **1. Union of Multisets**

The union takes the **maximum** number of times each element appears in either multiset.

* **Example**:
  A = {l, l, m, m, n, n, n, n}
  B = {l, m, m, m, n}
  A ‚à™ B = {l, l, m, m, m, n, n, n, n}
  (We take the higher count for each element)

---

#### **2. Intersection of Multisets**

The intersection takes the **minimum** number of times each element appears in both A and B.

* **Example**:
  A = {l, l, m, n, p, q, q, r}
  B = {l, m, m, p, q, r, r, r, r}
  A ‚à© B = {l, m, p, q, r}
  (We include each element as many times as it appears in **both**, taking the smaller count)

---

#### **3. Difference of Multisets (A ‚Äì B)**

In this case, we subtract how many times each element appears in B from how many times it appears in A.
If the result is negative or zero, we don‚Äôt include it.

* **Example**:
  A = {l, m, m, m, n, n, n, p, p, p}
  B = {l, m, m, m, n, r, r, r}
  A ‚Äì B = {n, n, p, p, p}
  (We remove elements of B from A ‚Äî only what‚Äôs leftover stays)

---

#### **4. Sum of Multisets (A + B)**

Here, we simply add how many times each element appears in both multisets.

* **Example**:
  A = {l, m, n, p, r}
  B = {l, l, m, n, n, n, p, r, r}
  A + B = {l, l, l, m, m, n, n, n, n, p, p, r, r, r}
  (Just stack them together and add the counts)

---

#### **5. Cardinality of a Multiset**

This refers to **how many different elements** are present ‚Äî **not** how many total items.

* **Example**:
  A = {l, l, m, m, n, n, n, p, p, p, p, q, q, q}
  So, distinct elements are: l, m, n, p, q ‚Üí
  **Cardinality = 5**
  (Even though total items = 14)

---


### **1.5 Venn Diagrams**

A **Venn diagram** is a simple way to visually show relationships between different sets. It uses shapes ‚Äî usually **circles** ‚Äî to represent sets, and overlapping areas show common elements.

This tool helps us easily understand set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

---

### **Where Did Venn Diagrams Come From?**

They were introduced by **John Venn** (1834‚Äì1883), a mathematician and logician. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre called ‚ÄúVenn diagrams.‚Äù They're sometimes also called **set diagrams** or **logic diagrams**.

---

### **How They Work:**

Each **circle** (or closed shape) represents a **set**. If two circles overlap, the shaded overlap represents the **intersection** ‚Äî elements common to both. If circles don't touch, the sets are **disjoint**, meaning they have nothing in common.

Venn diagrams can show:

* **Union** ‚Üí All elements from both sets
* **Intersection** ‚Üí Only common elements
* **Difference** ‚Üí Elements in one set but not in the other
* **Subset** ‚Üí One circle fully inside another

---

### **Examples from the Image Above:**

1. **First diagram (3 circles - A, B, C)**
   The central shaded region shows **A ‚à© B ‚à© C** ‚Äî the elements that are **common to all three sets**.

2. **Second diagram (A and B, fully shaded)**
   This represents **A ‚à™ B** ‚Äî the **union** of sets A and B (everything in either A or B or both).

3. **Third diagram (A shaded, but not overlapping part of B)**
   This is **A ‚àí B** ‚Äî the **difference**, meaning elements in A that are **not in B**.

---

### **Why Use Venn Diagrams?**

* They‚Äôre helpful in solving problems in **set theory**, **logic**, and **probability**.
* You can quickly spot relationships between sets.
* Great for visual learners!

---



### **1.6 Propositional Logic (Statement Logic)**

Propositional logic is the basic building block of logic in mathematics and computer science. It works with **propositions** ‚Äî these are simple statements that are either **true or false**, but **not both**.

---

### ‚úÖ **What is a Proposition?**

A **proposition** is a statement that declares something clearly. It‚Äôs **not a question or command**, but a sentence that is either **true** or **false**.

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Examples of propositions:

* `5 + 2 = 7` ‚Üí ‚úÖ (true)
* `Bananas are green` ‚Üí ‚ùå (depends, but still valid as a proposition)
* `Delhi is the capital of the US` ‚Üí ‚ùå (false, but still a proposition)
* `Karnataka is in India` ‚Üí ‚úÖ (true)

As long as a sentence can be **clearly true or false**, it's a proposition.

---

### üß± **Types of Propositions**

There are two main types:

---

#### **1. Atomic Proposition**

* These are **basic statements**.
* They **cannot be broken down** any further.
* They just say one thing and stand alone.

‚úÖ Example:

* `p: 5 + 3 = 8`
* `q: Bananas are yellow`

These are **atomic** because they don‚Äôt contain any logical connectors like "and", "or", etc.

---

#### **2. Compound Proposition**

* These are made by **combining atomic propositions** using **logical connectives**.
* Think of them like **sentences joined with AND, OR, NOT, IF‚Ä¶THEN** etc.

‚úÖ Examples:

* `It is sunny today AND I will go to school`
* `Oranges are orange OR bananas are yellow`

---

### üîó **Logical Connectives**

Here are common connectives used in propositional logic:

* **AND ( ‚àß )**
* **OR ( ‚à® )**
* **NOT ( ¬¨ )**
* **IMPLIES ( ‚Üí )**
* **IF AND ONLY IF ( ‚Üî )**

We use these to **build compound propositions**.

---

### üß© **Based on Truth Values, Propositions Can Be:**

1. **Tautology** ‚Äì Always true
   Example: `p ‚à® ¬¨p` ‚Üí This is always true, no matter what p is.

2. **Contradiction** ‚Äì Always false
   Example: `p ‚àß ¬¨p` ‚Üí Can never be true at the same time.

3. **Contingency** ‚Äì Could be true or false depending on the value of the variables.

---

### ‚ùå **Not Propositions:**

Some sentences **look like statements**, but they‚Äôre **not** considered propositions because you can‚Äôt assign ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù directly.

Examples:

* Commands ‚Üí ‚ÄúClose the door.‚Äù
* Questions ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù
* Exclamations ‚Üí ‚ÄúWow, amazing!‚Äù
* Incomplete / inconsistent sentences ‚Üí ‚ÄúIf it rains‚Ä¶‚Äù
* Predicates (like ‚Äúx is greater than 5‚Äù) ‚Üí It‚Äôs only a proposition **once you assign a value** to x.

---

## **1.7 Propositions and Logical Operations**

When we work with **propositional logic**, we use **logical operators** (called *connectives*) to combine or manipulate statements (propositions).

---

### üîó **Common Logical Connectives**

There are five main logical operations you need to know:

| Symbol | Name                 | Meaning                        |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ‚à®      | OR (Disjunction)     | True if *at least one* is true |
| ‚àß      | AND (Conjunction)    | True *only if both* are true   |
| ¬¨      | NOT (Negation)       | Reverses the truth value       |
| ‚Üí      | IMPLIES              | ‚ÄúIf A then B‚Äù                  |
| ‚áî      | IFF (Bi-conditional) | ‚ÄúA if and only if B‚Äù           |

---

### 1. **OR ( ‚à® ) ‚Äì Disjunction**

* It‚Äôs true if **either A or B or both** are true.
* False **only** when *both* are false.

üìä Truth Table:

```
A      B      A ‚à® B
T      T      T
T      F      T
F      T      T
F      F      F
```

---

### 2. **AND ( ‚àß ) ‚Äì Conjunction**

* It‚Äôs true **only if both** A and B are true.
* False in all other cases.

üìä Truth Table:

```
A      B      A ‚àß B
T      T      T
T      F      F
F      T      F
F      F      F
```

---

### 3. **NOT ( ¬¨ ) ‚Äì Negation**

* It flips the truth value.
* If A is true, then ¬¨A is false.

üìä Truth Table:

```
A      ¬¨A
T      F
F      T
```

---

### 4. **Implication ( ‚Üí ) ‚Äì If A then B**

* ‚ÄúIf A, then B‚Äù is only false **when A is true and B is false**.
* All other combinations are considered **true**.

üìä Truth Table:

```
A      B      A ‚Üí B
T      T      T
T      F      F
F      T      T
F      F      T
```

---

### 5. **Bi-conditional ( ‚áî ) ‚Äì If and Only If**

* True if **both A and B are the same** (either both true or both false).
* False when their truth values **differ**.

üìä Truth Table:

```
A      B      A ‚áî B
T      T      T
T      F      F
F      T      F
F      F      T
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Tautology**

A **tautology** is a logical expression that is always true, no matter the values of the variables.

**Example:**
Prove that `[(A ‚Üí B) ‚àß A] ‚Üí B` is a tautology.

üìä Truth Table:

```
A      B      A ‚Üí B     (A ‚Üí B) ‚àß A     Final Expression
T      T      T         T                T
T      F      F         F                T
F      T      T         F                T
F      F      T         F                T
```

Since final result is always **True**, it's a tautology ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ùå **Contradiction**

A **contradiction** is always **false**, regardless of the variable values.

**Example:**
`(A ‚à® B) ‚àß [(¬¨A) ‚àß (¬¨B)]`

üìä Truth Table:

```
A      B     A ‚à® B   ¬¨A   ¬¨B   (¬¨A ‚àß ¬¨B)   Final
T      T      T      F    F     F         F
T      F      T      F    T     F         F
F      T      T      T    F     F         F
F      F      F      T    T     T         F
```

Final column = always **False** ‚Üí contradiction ‚ùå

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Contingency**

A **contingency** is a formula that is **true in some cases and false in others**.

**Example:**
`(A ‚à® B) ‚àß (¬¨A)`

üìä Truth Table:

```
A      B     A ‚à® B   ¬¨A   Final
T      T      T      F    F
T      F      T      F    F
F      T      T      T    T
F      F      F      T    F
```

The final result is a mix of T and F ‚Üí contingency ‚öñÔ∏è

## **1.8 Functionally Complete Set of Connectives**

In **propositional logic**, a **functionally complete set** is a collection of logical connectives (like AND, OR, NOT) that can be combined to **express any possible truth table**‚Äîin other words, any Boolean function.

---

### üîß What Does ‚ÄúFunctionally Complete‚Äù Mean?

A set of connectives is **functionally complete** if we can create **any logical expression** using just those connectives.

---

### ‚úÖ Examples of Functionally Complete Sets:

| Set        | Functionally Complete?        | Why?                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| {AND, NOT} | ‚úÖ Yes                         | You can derive OR and all others from these |
| {OR, NOT}  | ‚úÖ Yes                         | You can express AND using De Morgan‚Äôs Law   |
| {NAND}     | ‚úÖ Yes (single universal gate) | NAND alone can express all operations       |
| {NOR}      | ‚úÖ Yes (also universal)        | Like NAND, it covers all Boolean functions  |

---

### ‚ùå Incomplete Sets:

| Set       | Functionally Complete? | Why Not?                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| {AND, OR} | ‚ùå No                   | You **can‚Äôt express NOT** with just these two |

---

### üí° Universal Gates in Digital Logic:

* **NAND** and **NOR** gates are called **universal gates** because they alone can be used to build **any logic circuit**.

This idea directly links propositional logic with **Boolean algebra** and **digital electronics**.

---

## **1.9 Well-Formed Formulas (WFFs)**

A **well-formed formula** (abbreviated **WFF**) is a string of symbols in **propositional or predicate logic** that is constructed according to the formal syntax rules of that logic system.

Think of WFFs as **grammatically correct logical expressions** ‚Äî just like a proper sentence in English follows grammar rules.

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è What Makes a Formula ‚ÄúWell-Formed‚Äù?

A formula is **well-formed** if:

1. It uses **only valid symbols** (propositional variables like A, B, connectives like ‚àß, ‚à®, ¬¨, etc.)
2. It follows **the rules of syntax** for the logic system.

---

### üî§ Syntax Rules (Propositional Logic):

1. **Any capital letter alone** (like A, B, P, Q) is a WFF.
2. **If œÜ is a WFF, then ¬¨œÜ is also a WFF.**
3. **If œÜ and œà are WFFs**, then so are:

   * (œÜ ‚àß œà)
   * (œÜ ‚à® œà)
   * (œÜ ‚Üí œà)
   * (œÜ ‚áî œà)

---

### ‚úÖ Examples of WFFs (with reasoning):

| Formula         | Why it's a WFF                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| A               | Rule 1 ‚Äì A single variable          |
| ¬¨A              | Rule 2 ‚Äì Negation of a WFF          |
| (¬¨A ‚à® B)        | Rule 3 ‚Äì OR between WFFs            |
| ((¬¨A ‚à® B) ‚àß C)  | Rule 3 ‚Äì AND combining two WFFs     |
| ¬¨((¬¨A ‚à® B) ‚àß C) | Rule 2 ‚Äì Negation of a complete WFF |

---

### ‚ùå Non-WFF Examples (with issues):

| Formula      | Why it's NOT a WFF                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| A\~          | Negation must go before, not after          |
| (A)          | Single terms don‚Äôt need parentheses         |
| (A ‚àß )       | Missing second operand                      |
| (A ‚àß B) ‚Üí C) | Unbalanced/missing opening parenthesis      |
| (A ‚àß ‚Üí B)    | Invalid use of connective (incomplete pair) |

---

### üß† WFFs in Predicate Logic

In **predicate logic**, WFFs can include:

* **Atomic formulas** like P(x), Q(y, z)
* Quantifiers: ‚àÄx P(x) and ‚àÉx Q(x, y)
* Combinations using logical connectives

These form **statements** that can be **true or false** once values are assigned to variables.

---

### üéØ Summary

| Concept                   | Description                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

## **1.10 Laws of Logical Equivalence**

In propositional logic, **two propositions are said to be logically equivalent** if they always yield the **same truth value**‚Äîregardless of the truth values of the individual components.

---

### üîÑ What is Logical Equivalence?

We say:

> `p ‚â° q` (read as *"p is logically equivalent to q"*)
> if the compound proposition `(p ‚Üî q)` is a **tautology** (i.e., always true).

---

### üß† Why Use Logical Equivalence?

* It simplifies complex logical statements.
* It helps in constructing formal proofs.
* It ensures that while rewriting expressions, **truth remains unchanged**.
* It's similar to using algebraic identities to simplify math equations.

---

### ‚úÖ Fundamental Equivalence Laws

The table below summarizes **commonly used logical equivalences**:

| **Equivalence**                                                        | **Name of Identity** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `p ‚àß T ‚â° p`, `p ‚à® F ‚â° p`                                               | Identity Laws        |
| `p ‚à® T ‚â° T`, `p ‚àß F ‚â° F`                                               | Domination Laws      |
| `p ‚à® p ‚â° p`, `p ‚àß p ‚â° p`                                               | Idempotent Law       |
| `¬¨(¬¨p) ‚â° p`                                                            | Double Negation Law  |
| `p ‚àß q ‚â° q ‚àß p`, `p ‚à® q ‚â° q ‚à® p`                                       | Commutative Laws     |
| `(p ‚àß q) ‚àß r ‚â° p ‚àß (q ‚àß r)`<br>`(p ‚à® q) ‚à® r ‚â° p ‚à® (q ‚à® r)`             | Associative Laws     |
| `p ‚àß (q ‚à® r) ‚â° (p ‚àß q) ‚à® (p ‚àß r)`<br>`p ‚à® (q ‚àß r) ‚â° (p ‚à® q) ‚àß (p ‚à® r)` | Distributive Laws    |
| `¬¨(p ‚àß q) ‚â° ¬¨p ‚à® ¬¨q`<br>`¬¨(p ‚à® q) ‚â° ¬¨p ‚àß ¬¨q`                           | De Morgan‚Äôs Laws     |
| `p ‚à® (p ‚àß q) ‚â° p`, `p ‚àß (p ‚à® q) ‚â° p`                                   | Absorption Laws      |
| `p ‚àß ¬¨p ‚â° F`, `p ‚à® ¬¨p ‚â° T`                                             | Negation Laws        |

---

### üîç Example Use:

Let‚Äôs simplify the following using logical equivalences:

> **Expression:** `(p ‚àß T) ‚à® (p ‚àß ¬¨p)`

Step-by-step:

1. Use **Identity Law**: `p ‚àß T ‚â° p`
   ‚Üí So expression becomes `p ‚à® (p ‚àß ¬¨p)`

2. Use **Absorption Law**: `p ‚à® (p ‚àß q) ‚â° p`
   ‚Üí Final answer: `p`

---

### üß† Summary

* Logical equivalences are **logical ‚Äúidentities‚Äù** that preserve truth.
* They're essential in simplifying statements and solving logic-based problems.
* Equivalence can be proven using either:

  * **Truth Tables** (brute force), or
  * **Algebraic rules** (elegant proofs using known identities).

---


## **1.11 Normal Forms**

In logic, **normal forms** are standardized ways of expressing compound propositions. These forms help in simplifying, evaluating, or automating logic-based expressions, especially in areas like computer science, AI, and mathematics.

We mainly deal with two types of normal forms:

---

### üîπ **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**

A statement is said to be in **Conjunctive Normal Form** if it's a **conjunction (AND)** of multiple **disjunctions (OR)**. Each disjunction (called a *clause*) is enclosed in parentheses.

#### ‚úÖ Structure:

* **(A ‚à® B) ‚àß (¬¨C ‚à® D) ‚àß (E ‚à® F ‚à® G)**

#### üîÅ In terms of sets:

* It's like **intersecting unions** ‚Üí (A ‚à™ B) ‚à© (C ‚à™ D)

#### üß† Example:

* `(A ‚à® B) ‚àß (A ‚à® C) ‚àß (B ‚à® C ‚à® D)`

---

### üî∏ **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**

A statement is in **Disjunctive Normal Form** if it's a **disjunction (OR)** of multiple **conjunctions (AND)**. Each group of ANDed variables is also enclosed in parentheses.

#### ‚úÖ Structure:

* **(A ‚àß B) ‚à® (¬¨C ‚àß D) ‚à® (E ‚àß F ‚àß G)**

#### üîÅ In terms of sets:

* It's like **uniting intersections** ‚Üí (A ‚à© B) ‚à™ (C ‚à© D)

#### üß† Example:

* `(A ‚àß B) ‚à® (A ‚àß C) ‚à® (B ‚àß C ‚àß D)`

---



## **1.12 Predicate Calculus**

While propositional logic deals with whole statements like "The sky is blue", **predicate logic** goes deeper and examines the **structure** of statements ‚Äî especially those involving variables.

---

### üîπ **What is a Predicate?**

A **predicate** is a logical statement involving variables. It becomes a full **proposition** (a statement that's true or false) only when the variables are filled in or quantified.

#### üß† Example:

* Let `P(x)` = "x is a student"
* Then `P(Ram)` = "Ram is a student" (a full statement)

---

### üî∏ **Predicate Formulas**

A predicate with **n variables** is written as:

* `P(x1, x2, ..., xn)`
  For example: `M(x, y)` = ‚Äúx is married to y‚Äù

These are also known as **atomic formulas**.

---

### üîπ **Quantifiers in Predicate Logic**

Quantifiers help generalize a statement over a domain of values.

---

#### 1. **Universal Quantifier ( ‚àÄ )**

Means **"for all"** or **"every"**

üß† Example:

* ‚àÄx P(x) = "All x satisfy P"
* ‚àÄx "x is mortal" ‚Üí "All humans are mortal"

---

#### 2. **Existential Quantifier ( ‚àÉ )**

Means **"there exists"** or **"some"**

üß† Example:

* ‚àÉx P(x) = "There is at least one x such that P(x) is true"
* ‚àÉx "x is dishonest" ‚Üí "Some people are dishonest"

---

### ‚úÖ **Well-Formed Formula (WFF)** in Predicate Logic

A WFF is a correctly structured expression that follows the grammar of logical syntax.

#### Rules:

* All propositional constants/variables are WFFs
* If `x` is a variable and `Y` is a WFF, then both ‚àÄx Y and ‚àÉx Y are WFFs
* Atomic formulas are WFFs (like `P(x, y)`)
* WFFs can be combined using connectives: `¬¨, ‚àß, ‚à®, ‚Üí, ‚áî`

---

### üîç Summary

* Predicate logic allows reasoning about **properties** and **relationships**.
* **Quantifiers** help you express generality (`‚àÄ`) and existence (`‚àÉ`).
* Structuring logic into **normal forms (CNF/DNF)** or **WFFs** helps in proofs, logic design, and automated reasoning.

---



## **1.13 Rules of Inference**

**Inference rules** are the foundational tools used to build valid logical arguments. These rules allow us to derive conclusions from given premises using universally accepted logical patterns. Each rule defines a structure of reasoning that preserves **truth** ‚Äî meaning if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.

In logic and mathematics, inference rules are used extensively in proofs, reasoning engines, and decision-making systems.

---

### üß© **What is an Argument?**

An **argument** is a series of statements:

* The **initial statements** are called **premises** (or hypotheses).
* The **final statement** is called the **conclusion**.
* The symbol ‚Äú‚à¥‚Äù (therefore) is used just before the conclusion.

---

### üìò **Commonly Used Inference Rules**

| **Rule of Inference**            | **Tautology (Justification)**    | **Name**                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. `p`, `p ‚Üí q` ‚üπ `‚à¥ q`          | `(p ‚àß (p ‚Üí q)) ‚Üí q`              | **Modus Ponens** (If p implies q and p is true, then q must be true.)    |
| 2. `¬¨q`, `p ‚Üí q` ‚üπ `‚à¥ ¬¨p`        | `(¬¨q ‚àß (p ‚Üí q)) ‚Üí ¬¨p`            | **Modus Tollens** (If q is false and p implies q, then p must be false.) |
| 3. `p ‚Üí q`, `q ‚Üí r` ‚üπ `‚à¥ p ‚Üí r`  | `((p ‚Üí q) ‚àß (q ‚Üí r)) ‚Üí (p ‚Üí r)`  | **Hypothetical Syllogism** (Chaining implications.)                      |
| 4. `p ‚à® q`, `¬¨p` ‚üπ `‚à¥ q`         | `((p ‚à® q) ‚àß ¬¨p) ‚Üí q`             | **Disjunctive Syllogism** (Eliminating one possibility from an OR.)      |
| 5. `p` ‚üπ `‚à¥ p ‚à® q`               | `p ‚Üí (p ‚à® q)`                    | **Addition** (You can add more possibilities using OR.)                  |
| 6. `p ‚àß q` ‚üπ `‚à¥ p`               | `(p ‚àß q) ‚Üí p`                    | **Simplification** (From a conjunction, either part is true.)            |
| 7. `p`, `q` ‚üπ `‚à¥ p ‚àß q`          | `(p ‚àß q)`                        | **Conjunction** (If both statements are true, you can combine them.)     |
| 8. `p ‚à® q`, `¬¨p ‚à® r` ‚üπ `‚à¥ q ‚à® r` | `((p ‚à® q) ‚àß (¬¨p ‚à® r)) ‚Üí (q ‚à® r)` | **Resolution** (Used to simplify complex disjunctions.)                  |

---

### üß† **Why These Matter**

* These rules **ensure the correctness** of logical reasoning.
* They are used in **mathematical proofs**, **computer science (e.g., compilers, theorem provers)**, **AI algorithms**, and **philosophical reasoning**.
* Learning these rules is essential for solving logical puzzles and for building reliable systems that can **derive truths** from known facts.

---


## **1.14 Notion of Proof**

In mathematics, a **proof** is a logical explanation that confirms the truth of a statement or theorem. It isn‚Äôt just about checking whether something works ‚Äî it‚Äôs about justifying **why** it must work, every time, under the given assumptions.

To construct a proof, we usually:

* Start with a **statement** (or **proposition**) we want to prove.
* Use **logical reasoning** and **operators** (AND, OR, NOT, IF-THEN, etc.).
* Sometimes use **quantifiers** like ‚Äúfor all‚Äù (‚àÄ) or ‚Äúthere exists‚Äù (‚àÉ).

Let‚Äôs explore the different **types of proofs** commonly used in mathematics.

---

### **1. Proof by Cases**

In this method, we consider all possible cases and show the statement holds true in each.

**Example**: Show that for any integer x, the product x(x+1) is even.

* **Case 1**: If x is even ‚áí x = 2k ‚áí x(x+1) = 2k(2k+1) ‚áí divisible by 2 ‚áí even.
* **Case 2**: If x is odd ‚áí x = 2k+1 ‚áí x(x+1) = (2k+1)(2k+2) = 2(k+1)(2k+1) ‚áí again even.

‚úÖ In both cases, the product is even. So the statement is true.

---

### **2. Proof by Contradiction**

This method assumes the **opposite** (negation) of what you're trying to prove, and shows that this leads to a contradiction ‚Äî hence, the original statement must be true.

**Example**: Prove that ‚àö2 is irrational.

* Suppose ‚àö2 is rational ‚áí ‚àö2 = a/b (in lowest terms)
* Then, 2 = a¬≤ / b¬≤ ‚áí a¬≤ = 2b¬≤ ‚áí a is even ‚áí a = 2k
* Substitute back ‚áí 4k¬≤ = 2b¬≤ ‚áí b¬≤ = 2k¬≤ ‚áí b is also even.
* But now both a and b are even ‚áí common factor of 2 ‚áí contradicts "lowest terms".

‚ùå Contradiction ‚áí ‚àö2 cannot be rational ‚áí So ‚àö2 is irrational.

---

### **3. Proof by Induction**

This is like climbing an infinite staircase: show the **first step works** (base case), then prove that if one step works, the **next step must also work**.

**Example**: Prove 1 + 2 + ‚Ä¶ + n = n(n+1)/2

* **Base Case** (n = 1): 1 = 1(1+1)/2 = 1 ‚úÖ
* **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume true for n ‚áí 1 + ‚Ä¶ + n = n(n+1)/2
* **Step**: Show it holds for n+1 ‚áí Add (n+1) to both sides:

  n(n+1)/2 + (n+1)
  \= \[n(n+1) + 2(n+1)] / 2
  \= (n+1)(n+2)/2 ‚úÖ

So, by **induction**, the formula is true for all positive integers n.

---

### **4. Direct Proof**

Here, you **start from the assumption** (premise) and logically deduce the conclusion.

**Example**: If m is even and n is odd, then m + n is odd.

* Let m = 2j (even), n = 2k+1 (odd)
* m + n = 2j + 2k + 1 = 2(j + k) + 1 ‚áí clearly an odd number ‚úÖ

This is a **straightforward, constructive** proof.

---

### **5. Indirect Proofs**

These include:

#### a) **Contrapositive Proof**

Instead of proving P ‚áí Q directly, we prove ¬¨Q ‚áí ¬¨P. These are logically equivalent.

**Example**: If 4n - 1 is prime, then n is odd.

* Prove the contrapositive: If n is even ‚áí n = 2k
* Then 4n - 1 = 4(2k) - 1 = 8k - 1 = (4k - 1)(4k + 1) ‚áí not prime ‚úÖ

#### b) **Proof by Contradiction** (Again)

Like above, assume ¬¨P and show that this leads to a contradiction.

**Example**: If ab is even, then either a or b is even.

* Assume both a and b are odd ‚áí ab is odd ‚áí contradicts ‚Äúab is even‚Äù
  ‚úÖ So, at least one of a or b must be even.

---

## üîç Final Thoughts

Proofs aren‚Äôt just technical ‚Äî they are the heart of how we know things are true in mathematics. Each type of proof has its own strengths:

* **Induction** is great for sequences and patterns.
* **Contradiction** is powerful when direct proof is tricky.
* **Direct proofs** are often the simplest but require the right structure.
