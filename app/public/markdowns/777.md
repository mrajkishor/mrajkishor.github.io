### üß† **Main Memory in Computer Architecture**

**Main Memory** (also called **Primary Memory** or **Internal Memory**) is the **central storage unit** in a computer that holds data, instructions, and programs that are currently in use. It acts as a **bridge** between the processor and slower storage devices like hard drives.

### üß© **Key Functions of Main Memory**

* Stores **programs and data** that the **CPU is actively using**
* Enables **fast read/write access** to CPU
* Transfers data between **secondary storage** and **processor**
* Acts as a **volatile memory** (contents are lost when power is off)

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technological Basis**

Main memory is built using **semiconductor-based integrated circuits** and is primarily composed of **RAM chips**, which come in two variants:

* **SRAM (Static RAM)**
* **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**

---

### üß™ **Types of Memory in Main Memory**

#### üü¢ 1. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**

* Allows **random (direct) access** to any memory location
* Divided into:

  * **SRAM (Static RAM)**:

    * Uses **flip-flops** to store data
    * Faster, more reliable, but **expensive**
    * Used in cache memory
  * **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**:

    * Stores data as **charge on capacitors**
    * Cheaper and denser than SRAM
    * Needs **periodic refreshing**
    * Used in the main memory of PCs

#### üü° 2. **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**

* Non-volatile memory (data persists after power off)
* Stores **firmware or bootloader**
* Cannot be easily modified

### üí° **Key Characteristics**

| Property     | RAM                     | ROM                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Volatility   | Volatile                | Non-volatile             |
| Writable     | Yes                     | No (in normal operation) |
| Use Case     | Temporary data/programs | Permanent firmware       |
| Access Speed | Fast                    | Slower than RAM          |

---

### üßÆ **Importance of RAM**

* Determines how many programs you can run simultaneously
* Size (e.g., 8GB, 16GB RAM) directly affects performance
* OS manages RAM allocation using **memory management units**

### üìä **Performance Metrics**

| Attribute      | SRAM  | DRAM        |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Speed          | Fast  | Slower      |
| Cost           | High  | Low         |
| Density        | Low   | High        |
| Used in        | Cache | Main Memory |
| Refresh Needed | No    | Yes         |

### üîÅ **Main Memory Flow Example**

1. Program stored in **secondary storage (e.g., HDD)**
2. Loaded into **main memory (RAM)** by the **OS**
3. CPU fetches instructions/data from RAM for execution
4. RAM is updated frequently during program execution

---

### üß∑ **Conclusion**

Main Memory is **central to system performance**, providing fast access to currently-used data and instructions. RAM (SRAM for speed, DRAM for capacity) makes it possible for computers to run modern applications smoothly. ROM ensures essential firmware is retained even when power is off.
