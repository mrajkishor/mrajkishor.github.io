# Exploring Named Queries in Spring Data JPA

Named Queries are a feature of JPA (Java Persistence API) that allow developers to define reusable, static queries directly within entity classes or XML files. Spring Data JPA enhances this by providing seamless integration with Named Queries, making it easier to execute predefined queries efficiently.

In this blog, weâ€™ll explore Named Queries in detail, their setup, and practical examples to demonstrate their usage.

## What Are Named Queries?

Named Queries are predefined, statically defined JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or SQL queries. They are defined using the `@NamedQuery` or `@NamedNativeQuery` annotations within an entity class or XML configuration.

### Key Features:
1. **Reusability**: Define a query once and reuse it across the application.
2. **Readability**: Named Queries provide a centralized location for query definitions.
3. **Efficiency**: Queries are parsed and validated at application startup, reducing runtime errors.

## Setting Up Named Queries

### Defining Named Queries

Named Queries can be defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation within an entity class.

#### Example Entity: `Employee`

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@NamedQueries({
    @NamedQuery(name = "Employee.findByDepartment",
                query = "SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :department"),
    @NamedQuery(name = "Employee.findBySalaryGreaterThan",
                query = "SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.salary > :salary")
})
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String department;
    private double salary;

    // Getters and setters

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getDepartment() {
        return department;
    }

    public void setDepartment(String department) {
        this.department = department;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
```

### Using Named Native Queries

For raw SQL queries, use `@NamedNativeQuery`.

```java
@NamedNativeQuery(name = "Employee.findAllNative",
                  query = "SELECT * FROM employee",
                  resultClass = Employee.class)
```

## Accessing Named Queries in Repositories

To use Named Queries in a Spring Data JPA repository, simply define methods matching the query names.

#### Repository:

```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import java.util.List;

public interface EmployeeRepository extends CrudRepository<Employee, Long> {

    @Query(name = "Employee.findByDepartment")
    List<Employee> findByDepartment(String department);

    @Query(name = "Employee.findBySalaryGreaterThan")
    List<Employee> findBySalaryGreaterThan(double salary);

    @Query(name = "Employee.findAllNative")
    List<Employee> findAllNative();
}
```

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Find Employees by Department

#### Usage:
```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

public void findEmployeesByDepartment() {
    List<Employee> itEmployees = employeeRepository.findByDepartment("IT");
    itEmployees.forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

#### Query Execution:
```sql
SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = 'IT';
```

### Example 2: Find Employees with Salary Greater Than

#### Usage:
```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

public void findHighEarners() {
    List<Employee> highEarners = employeeRepository.findBySalaryGreaterThan(50000);
    highEarners.forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

#### Query Execution:
```sql
SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.salary > 50000;
```

### Example 3: Using Named Native Query

#### Usage:
```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

public void findAllEmployeesNative() {
    List<Employee> employees = employeeRepository.findAllNative();
    employees.forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

#### Query Execution:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

## Testing Named Queries

### 1. Start the Application
Run your Spring Boot application.

### 2. Insert Sample Data
Use `data.sql` or manual entries to populate the database.

### 3. Test Endpoints
Use Postman, Curl, or integration tests to invoke repository methods.

## Advantages of Named Queries

1. **Centralized Query Management**: Queries are defined in one place, improving maintainability.
2. **Pre-Validation**: Queries are parsed and validated at application startup.
3. **Reusability**: Define once, reuse multiple times.
4. **Readability**: Queries are named descriptively, improving code clarity.

---

## Limitations of Named Queries

1. **Static Nature**: Named Queries are static and cannot be dynamically generated at runtime.
2. **Limited Flexibility**: Complex dynamic conditions may require Criteria API or custom queries.

---

## Conclusion

Named Queries in Spring Data JPA provide a robust way to manage predefined, reusable queries efficiently. Whether you are using JPQL or raw SQL, Named Queries improve code readability, maintainability, and runtime efficiency. For dynamic use cases, consider combining Named Queries with other Spring Data JPA features like Criteria API or Derived Queries. Experiment with these tools to optimize your data access layers!
