## 📘 Measures – Categorization and Computation in Data Warehousing

---

### 🔹 What Are Measures?

In a **data warehouse**, **measures** are **numerical values** stored in the **fact table** that represent quantities to be **analyzed** — such as sales, profit, quantity, or revenue.

They are the **“what you want to analyze”** part of a data cube.

---

### 🔹 Example:

In a `SalesFact` table:

| Date       | ProductID | StoreID | Revenue | UnitsSold |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| 2024-07-15 | 101       | 21      | 25,000  | 50        |

* Here, `Revenue` and `UnitsSold` are **measures**.

---

## 🔷 Categorization of Measures

Measures are categorized based on how they **behave during aggregation** across dimensions:

---

### ✅ 1. **Additive Measures**

* Can be **summed up across all dimensions**
* Most common and useful for aggregations

> ✅ Example: `Sales Amount`, `Profit`, `Units Sold`

```sql
SUM(Revenue) BY Month
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Semi-Additive Measures**

* Can be added **along some dimensions**, but **not all**

> ✅ Example: `Account Balance`, `Inventory Level`

You can add balances across time *for one customer*, but not across *all customers at a point in time*.

---

### ✅ 3. **Non-Additive Measures**

* **Cannot be aggregated** using `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

> ✅ Example: `Ratios`, `Percentages`, `Averages`, `Rates`

These require special **derived calculations** during analysis.

### 🔹 Summary Table

| Measure Type  | Aggregation Possible?   | Example              |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Additive      | Across all dimensions   | Sales, Revenue       |
| Semi-Additive | Some dimensions only    | Inventory, Balance   |
| Non-Additive  | Not directly aggregable | Profit Margin %, ROI |

## 🔷 Computation of Measures (Aggregation Functions)

---

### ✅ Common Aggregation Functions in OLAP:

| Function   | Purpose            |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| `SUM()`    | Total of values    |
| `COUNT()`  | Number of rows     |
| `AVG()`    | Average value      |
| `MAX()`    | Maximum value      |
| `MIN()`    | Minimum value      |
| `STDDEV()` | Standard deviation |

---

### ✅ Derived Measures

* Computed from **base measures**
* Not stored in fact tables, but calculated during query

> Example:

```text
Profit = Revenue – Cost  
Profit Margin = Profit / Revenue
```

---

### ✅ Measures in Data Cubes

In a **multidimensional cube**, measures are analyzed across:

* **Time**
* **Location**
* **Product**
* **Customer**

This allows **OLAP operations** like:

* Roll-up (e.g., daily → monthly revenue)
* Drill-down (e.g., yearly → monthly → daily profit)
* Slice (e.g., sales for product A)
* Dice (e.g., sales in Region X, Month Y, Product Z)
