##  **Profiling Tools (JVisualVM, YourKit)**

---

## üéØ Why Java Profiling?

Java applications, especially in production, can face:

* High CPU usage
* Memory leaks (leading to `OutOfMemoryError`)
* Thread contention and deadlocks
* Latency in method execution
* GC (Garbage Collection) pauses

Profiling tools like **JVisualVM** and **YourKit** allow you to **analyze runtime behavior**, diagnose bottlenecks, and optimize performance ‚Äî which is critical at enterprise scale projects.

---

## üìå What is Profiling?

> **Profiling** is the act of measuring the **memory usage**, **CPU cycles**, **method execution time**, and **thread activity** of a running Java process.

# üõ†Ô∏è 1. **JVisualVM**

---

### ‚úÖ What is JVisualVM?

**JVisualVM** is a profiling tool included with the JDK (`bin/jvisualvm`) that can attach to **local or remote JVMs** and provide live information about:

* Heap usage
* GC activity
* Thread state
* CPU and memory profiling
* Class loading and JMX metrics

---

### üîå How to Launch

```bash
jvisualvm
```

> Works with applications running on the **same machine** or exposed via **JMX**.
