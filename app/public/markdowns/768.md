## 🖥️ Peripheral Devices – Detailed Note

### 🔍 What Are Peripheral Devices?

**Peripheral Devices** are external or internal hardware components that **connect to a computer system** to perform **input, output, or storage tasks**. They are not part of the core CPU but interact with it to exchange or display data.

> Any device that aids in **inputting data to the system**, **outputting results**, or **storing data externally** is considered a peripheral.

---

### ⚙️ Role in a Computer System

* **Input**: Accepts data from the user or environment (e.g., keyboard, mouse, scanner)
* **Output**: Displays or communicates results from the system (e.g., monitor, printer)
* **Storage**: Stores large volumes of data (e.g., magnetic disks, tapes)
* **Communication**: Facilitates data transfer (e.g., modems)

> Peripherals function by **receiving instructions from the CPU** and **reading/writing** data to memory or external media.
