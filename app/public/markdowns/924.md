## 🧪 Yup — Schema-Based Form Validation in React

---

## 📌 What Is Yup?

[Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) is a **JavaScript schema validation library**, heavily inspired by Joi but built with a functional approach. In the React ecosystem, especially in forms, **Yup is the de facto standard** for declarative, reusable, and robust form validation.

It’s most commonly used with:

* **Formik**
* **React Hook Form** (via resolver)
* **Zustand/Redux**-based forms

But it’s agnostic — it can be used with any JS form logic.

---

## 🎯 Why Do Enterprise-Level Engineers Use Yup?

* Validates complex nested form structures declaratively
* Centralizes business rules in one place (cleaner than inline logic)
* Pairs cleanly with form libraries for DRY, testable code
* Enables better **error formatting**, **i18n**, and **conditional logic**

> At scale, **Yup helps enforce consistency and predictability across teams**.

---

## 📦 Basic Yup Schema

```ts
import * as Yup from 'yup';

const loginSchema = Yup.object({
  email: Yup.string().email('Invalid email').required('Required'),
  password: Yup.string().min(8, 'Min 8 chars').required('Required'),
});
```

You can now plug this into a form library like Formik or React Hook Form.

## 🔐 Common Yup Validators

| Validator              | Purpose                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `string()`, `number()` | Primitive type check                |
| `required()`           | Field must exist and be non-empty   |
| `min(n)`, `max(n)`     | Length or numeric constraints       |
| `email()`              | Email format                        |
| `matches(regex)`       | Custom pattern                      |
| `oneOf([...])`         | Value must match one from a list    |
| `when()`               | Conditional validation              |
| `nullable()`           | Allows `null` values explicitly     |
| `shape({})`            | Validates nested objects            |
| `array().of()`         | Validates arrays with child schemas |

---

## ✅ Realistic Example: Registration Schema

```ts
const registrationSchema = Yup.object({
  name: Yup.string().required(),
  email: Yup.string().email().required(),
  age: Yup.number().min(18).required(),
  password: Yup.string().min(8).required(),
  confirmPassword: Yup.string()
    .oneOf([Yup.ref('password')], 'Passwords must match')
    .required(),
});
```

Plug into Formik:

```tsx
<Formik
  initialValues={{ name: '', email: '', ... }}
  validationSchema={registrationSchema}
  onSubmit={...}
/>
```

---

## 🎯 Dynamic or Conditional Validation with `when()`

```ts
const schema = Yup.object({
  type: Yup.string().oneOf(['student', 'employee']),
  university: Yup.string().when('type', {
    is: 'student',
    then: Yup.string().required('University required for students'),
    otherwise: Yup.string().notRequired(),
  }),
});
```

🧠 This is **extremely useful** in real-world apps with toggle fields or user roles.

---

## 🧠 Nested Object Schema

```ts
const schema = Yup.object({
  user: Yup.object({
    name: Yup.string().required(),
    address: Yup.object({
      city: Yup.string().required(),
      zip: Yup.string().matches(/^\d{5}$/),
    }),
  }),
});
```

This mirrors the shape of complex form data — such as:

* Billing/Shipping forms
* Profile settings
* CMS content models

---

## 📄 Yup with React Hook Form (Zod Alternative)

```ts
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { yupResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/yup';

const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  formState: { errors },
} = useForm({
  resolver: yupResolver(schema),
});
```

✅ Yup becomes a clean plug-and-play validation layer.

---

## 🧪 Error Formatting & User Feedback

Yup provides clear, localized messages. You can customize all errors:

```ts
Yup.string()
  .email('Please enter a valid email address')
  .required('We need your email to contact you');
```

> This matters in product teams that care about **UX copywriting** and **i18n/l10n support**.

---

## 🧼 Optional & Nullable Fields

```ts
Yup.string().nullable() // allows null
Yup.string().notRequired() // allows undefined
```

✅ Useful when conditionally showing fields, or working with optional APIs.

## 🧰 Useful Utilities in Yup

| Utility            | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Yup.ref('field')` | References another field (e.g. for confirm password)      |
| `Yup.lazy()`       | Define schema dynamically based on value                  |
| `.test()`          | Write fully custom validation logic with access to value  |
| `.transform()`     | Modify value before validation (e.g., trim, parse number) |

---

## 🧠 Enterprise Architecture Tip

In Enterprise-level apps, validation schemas are usually **modularized and versioned**:

```ts
// src/validation/userSchemas.ts
export const loginSchema = ...
export const registrationSchema = ...
```

They’re often:

* Shared between backend & frontend (via OpenAPI or custom DSL)
* Composed across micro-frontends or feature modules
* Used in unit tests to verify edge cases

---

## 🧪 Testing Yup Schemas

```ts
it("should fail when password is too short", async () => {
  await expect(
    schema.validate({ password: "123" })
  ).rejects.toThrow("Must be at least 8 characters");
});
```

✅ This is a clean way to test just your validation logic in isolation.

## 🧠 Final Interview Tip

> “I prefer Yup when I want centralized, readable validation schemas that can be shared across forms. Its support for nested structures, dynamic logic, and testability makes it a strong fit for product-grade forms — and it integrates well with both Formik and React Hook Form.”
