# Two-Pointer Technique

The Two-Pointer technique is a powerful and efficient approach used in solving various data structure and algorithm problems. It is especially useful in problems related to searching, sorting, and pattern recognition. By utilizing two pointers, we can significantly optimize time complexity and reduce unnecessary iterations.

## What is the Two-Pointer Technique?
The Two-Pointer technique involves using two pointers to traverse a data structure, typically an array or a linked list. These pointers can move in the same direction (e.g., fast and slow pointers) or in opposite directions (e.g., left and right pointers) to solve the problem efficiently.

## Types of Two-Pointer Technique

### 1. **Opposite Direction Two-Pointers**
This type of approach involves using two pointers moving toward each other. This technique is commonly used in problems related to searching for pairs, checking for palindromes, and sorting problems.

#### Example 1: Checking if an Array has a Pair with a Given Sum
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class TwoSumSorted {
    public static boolean hasPairWithSum(int[] arr, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
            if (sum == target) {
                return true;
            } else if (sum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2, 7, 11, 15};
        int target = 9;
        System.out.println(hasPairWithSum(arr, target)); // Output: true
    }
}
```
### Explanation
- We sort the array first.
- Two pointers are placed at the start (`left = 0`) and end (`right = n-1`).
- We check if `arr[left] + arr[right]` equals the target.
- If the sum is smaller than the target, we move `left` to the right to increase the sum.
- If the sum is larger than the target, we move `right` to the left to decrease the sum.

This approach reduces the time complexity to **O(n log n)** due to sorting (or **O(n)** if the array is already sorted).

### 2. **Same Direction Two-Pointers**
This type of approach involves using two pointers moving in the same direction. It is commonly used in problems like finding the middle of a linked list, removing duplicates, and finding the longest subarray.

#### Example 2: Finding the Middle of a Linked List
```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; this.next = null; }
}

public class MiddleOfLinkedList {
    public static ListNode findMiddle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        return slow;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
        head.next = new ListNode(2);
        head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
        head.next.next.next = new ListNode(4);
        head.next.next.next.next = new ListNode(5);
        
        System.out.println("Middle Element: " + findMiddle(head).val); // Output: 3
    }
}
```
### Explanation
- We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`.
- `slow` moves one step at a time, while `fast` moves two steps.
- When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` is at the middle of the list.
- Time complexity: **O(n)**

### 3. **Sliding Window Two-Pointer Technique**
This approach is useful for finding subarrays with a given condition, like the longest substring without repeating characters or maximum sum subarrays.

#### Example 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class LongestSubstring {
    public static int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = 0, maxLength = 0;
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        while (right < s.length()) {
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
                set.add(s.charAt(right));
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
                right++;
            } else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
        }
        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "abcabcbb";
        System.out.println(lengthOfLongestSubstring(s)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```
### Explanation
- We maintain a **HashSet** to store unique characters in the current window.
- `right` expands the window by adding characters, and `left` shrinks it when a duplicate is found.
- The max length is updated whenever a larger valid window is found.
- Time complexity: **O(n)**

## Advantages of the Two-Pointer Technique
1. **Improves efficiency** - Reduces time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) in many problems.
2. **Easy to implement** - Simple to use with sorted arrays, linked lists, or strings.
3. **Optimized for memory** - Requires constant space O(1) in most cases.

## When to Use Two-Pointer Technique?
- When dealing with **sorted arrays or linked lists**.
- When **checking for pairs, triplets, or subarrays** that satisfy a given condition.
- When solving problems involving **window-based conditions**, such as substring problems.
- When trying to **find the middle or detect cycles in linked lists**.

## Conclusion
The Two-Pointer technique is a powerful tool in a programmerâ€™s arsenal. Whether optimizing searches, traversing arrays, or solving substring problems, it offers efficient solutions with reduced complexity. Mastering this technique can help in competitive programming and real-world coding interviews.
