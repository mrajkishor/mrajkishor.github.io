### **Chapter 5: Graph Theory – Core Concepts and Terminology**

#### 🔹 What is a Graph?

A graph is a way to model connections. It consists of:

* **Vertices (Nodes)**: The points
* **Edges (Links)**: Connections between those points

Mathematically: **G = (V, E)**
Where:

* `V` = set of vertices
* `E` = set of edges (can be ordered or unordered pairs of vertices)

---

### **Types of Graphs**

1. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have direction → (u, v) ≠ (v, u)

2. **Undirected Graph**: No direction, just a connection

3. **Other Classifications**:

   * **Null Graph**: No edges
   * **Simple Graph**: No loops or multiple edges
   * **Multigraph**: Multiple edges between the same pair of nodes
   * **Complete Graph**: Every node connected to every other node
   * **Cycle Graph**: Forms a loop or cycle
   * **Connected vs Disconnected**: All nodes reachable vs not
   * **Planar Graph**: Can be drawn on a plane without edges crossing

---

### **Basic Terminology**

* **Degree (deg(v))**: Number of edges connected to a vertex `v`
* **In-degree / Out-degree** (for directed graphs): Incoming vs outgoing edges
* **Adjacent Vertices**: Vertices connected by an edge
* **Path**: Sequence of edges connecting vertices
* **Cycle**: Path where the start and end vertex are the same

---

### **Special Graph Structures**

* **Tree**: Connected graph with no cycles
* **Forest**: A set of disjoint trees
* **Spanning Tree**: A tree that includes all vertices of the graph
* **Bridge**: An edge whose removal increases the number of disconnected components
* **Biconnected Graph**: Graph remains connected even after removing any one vertex

---

### **Graph Theory Operations**

* Create a graph
* Add/remove vertices
* Add/remove edges

---

### **Applications of Graphs**

* **Computer Science**: Searching, pathfinding (e.g. Dijkstra, BFS, DFS)
* **Networking**: Routing protocols, data flow
* **Biology**: DNA sequences, protein mapping
* **Linguistics**: Syntax trees, grammar rules
* **Real-world**: GPS navigation, social networks, scheduling

---

### **Popular Graph Algorithms**

* **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – Shortest path (greedy)
* **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** – Shortest path (handles negative weights)
* **Prim’s Algorithm** – Minimum Spanning Tree
* **Kruskal’s Algorithm** – Minimum Spanning Tree (based on sorting)
* **Ford–Fulkerson** – Maximum Flow in a flow network

### **5.2 Representation of Graphs**

In data structures, **graphs** are powerful tools to model relationships between entities. Every graph consists of:

* **Vertices (or nodes)** – represent entities.
* **Edges (or links)** – represent connections between those entities.

To efficiently store and manipulate graphs in memory, we use two standard representations:

---

### **1. Adjacency Matrix**

* It uses a 2D matrix (square table) of size `n × n` where `n` is the number of vertices.
* Each **cell (i, j)** tells whether there’s an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.

#### 🔸 **Undirected Graph**

* If an edge exists between two nodes, mark both `G[i][j] = 1` and `G[j][i] = 1`.
* For example, if there's an edge between A and B, both A→B and B→A will be marked.

#### 🔸 **Directed Graph**

* Direction matters, so only `G[i][j] = 1` if there's a directed edge from `i` to `j`.
* Not symmetric like undirected graphs.

#### 🔸 **Weighted Graph**

* Instead of 1s and 0s, you store the actual **weight or cost** of the edge.
* If no edge exists, the value is usually 0 or ∞.

📌 **Pros**:

* Easy to implement.
* Fast edge lookup: O(1)

📌 **Cons**:

* Wastes space for sparse graphs: O(n²)

---

### **2. Adjacency List**

* Instead of a matrix, each vertex stores a list of all the vertices it is connected to.
* Often implemented as an **array of linked lists** or **array of arrays**.

#### 🔸 **Example**:

For the graph:

```
A → B, C
B → D
D → B, D (self-loop)
```

Adjacency list:

```
A: B → C → D
B: D
C: 
D: B → D
```

📌 **Pros**:

* Saves space for sparse graphs.
* Easier to iterate over neighbors.

📌 **Cons**:

* Slower edge lookup: O(k) where k is the number of adjacent nodes.

---

### 🧠 Summary Table

| Representation   | Best For      | Space Complexity | Edge Lookup Time |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Adjacency Matrix | Dense graphs  | O(n²)            | O(1)             |
| Adjacency List   | Sparse graphs | O(V + E)         | O(k)             |

---

### 🔧 Real-life Use Cases

* **Social networks**: Who follows whom – adjacency list.
* **GPS systems**: Road distances – weighted adjacency matrix.
* **Web crawling**: Hyperlinks between pages – directed graph.
* **Network Routing**: Use adjacency lists for dynamic edge weights.

### 5.3 Bipartite, Regular, Planar, and Connected Graphs

#### 🔹 Bipartite Graph

A **bipartite graph** is a type of graph where the set of vertices can be split into two distinct groups—let’s call them `U` and `V`—such that every edge connects a vertex in `U` to a vertex in `V`. That means **no two nodes within the same set are directly connected**.

* Think of it like a two-team handshake: team U and team V. Handshakes only happen between members of different teams.
* These graphs are often used in matching problems (like job assignments or pairing tasks).

##### ✅ Complete Bipartite Graph:

If **every vertex in set U is connected to every vertex in set V**, we call it a **complete bipartite graph**.
It's denoted as **K<sub>m,n</sub>**, where `m` is the number of vertices in U and `n` in V.

---

#### 🔹 Regular Graph

A **regular graph** is one where every vertex has the **same number of edges** (same degree).

* If every node is connected to exactly 4 others, we call it a **4-regular graph**.
* This is useful in network design, where balanced connectivity is needed.

> In directed graphs, the in-degree and out-degree of each node must also be equal for the graph to be regular.

---

#### 🔹 Planar Graph

A **planar graph** is a graph that can be drawn on a flat surface (like a sheet of paper) **without any edges crossing**.

* The graph on the left in your image is **planar**, because it’s drawn without edge overlaps.
* The one on the right is **non-planar**, because edges cross no matter how you draw it.

##### 🧠 Key Properties of Planar Graphs:

1. For a connected planar graph: **v - e + r = 2**,
   where `v = vertices`, `e = edges`, and `r = regions`.
2. A complete graph K<sub>n</sub> is planar only if `n ≤ 4`.
3. A complete bipartite graph K<sub>m,n</sub> is planar only if `m ≤ 2` or `n ≤ 2`.

---

#### 🔹 Connected Graph

A graph is **connected** if **there’s a path between every pair of nodes**.
No node is left isolated or unreachable.

* In a **connected graph**, you can start from any vertex and reach any other.
* In a **disconnected graph**, there’s at least one node or group of nodes that are cut off.

---

### 5.4 Reachability and Connectedness

Let’s break it down simply: in a graph, **reachability** is about *“Can I get from one node to another?”*, while **connectedness** is about *“Is the whole graph held together?”*

---

#### 🔸 What is Reachability?

Reachability means you can **travel from one vertex to another** by moving along the edges.

* If there’s a way to go from **node A to node B** (step by step along the edges), then we say **B is reachable from A**.
* In terms of code or logic, we might say: `has_path(A, B) = true`.

✅ **Example:**
If there's a path like A → C → D → B, then B is reachable from A, even if they’re not directly connected.

---

#### 🔸 What is Connectedness?

Now, connectedness is a broader property of the **entire graph**.

* A graph is **connected** if **every vertex** can be reached from **every other vertex**.
* In contrast, if even one node is isolated or cut off (can’t be reached from the rest), the graph is **disconnected**.

👉 So basically:

> Reachability = applies to *a pair of nodes*
> Connectedness = applies to *the whole graph*

---

#### 🔸 Directed Graphs and Reachability

In **directed graphs** (where edges have direction), things get more interesting:

* Just because A can reach B doesn’t mean B can reach A.
* For a directed graph to be considered **strongly connected**, *every node must be reachable from every other node* following the direction of edges.

---

#### 🔸 Connected Components

A **connected component** is like a “chunk” of a graph that is fully connected within itself.

* You can’t add more nodes to it without breaking that internal connectivity.
* If a graph has **only one** such component, the graph is called **fully connected**.
* If a graph has **multiple components**, it’s **disconnected**.

🧩 Think of connected components like islands — within the island, everything is connected, but you can’t walk to another island unless there's a bridge (edge).

---

#### 🟡 Example Clarification

Sometimes, we might be asked:
“Find a path between nodes A and B where the total weight is ≤ 10.”

Even if a path exists from A to B, it might **not be considered reachable** under that **constraint** — so reachability can depend on **context**, especially in **weighted graphs**.

---

### ✅ Key Points to Remember

* **Reachability** is about moving between two nodes.
* **Connectedness** is about the overall structure of the graph.
* In **directed graphs**, direction matters.
* **Connected components** are the tightly-knit subgraphs within a bigger graph.
* A graph with only one connected component = **connected graph**.
