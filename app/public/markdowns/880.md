## 📘 Product of Maxterms (POS)

The **Product of Maxterms** is a canonical Boolean expression format in which the function is represented as the **AND (·)** of **sum terms**, also known as **Maxterms**. This format is the logical **complement of the Sum of Minterms (SOP)** representation.

It is called the **Canonical Product of Sums (POS)** because:

* Each **Maxterm** (sum term) corresponds to a unique row in the truth table where the function output is **0**.
* All such Maxterms are **ANDed together** to represent the complete Boolean function.

---

### 🔹 What is a Maxterm?

A **Maxterm** is a **sum (OR)** of all input variables in either their **true or complemented** form, such that the term evaluates to **false (0)** for one and only one combination of input values.

For *n* input variables, there are **2ⁿ Maxterms**, one for each possible input combination where the function evaluates to **0**.

### 🧮 Example: Boolean Function with 2 Inputs

Let’s define a Boolean function `F(A, B)` such that:

* F = 1 when only one of the inputs is 1 (i.e., either A or B is true, but not both)

#### 🧾 Truth Table:

| A | B | F |
| - | - | - |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

#### 🟩 Step 1: Identify rows where F = 0

* Row 1 → A=0, B=0 → Maxterm: A + B
* Row 4 → A=1, B=1 → Maxterm: A’ + B’

> Rule:
>
> * If input = 1 → use the variable's complement
> * If input = 0 → use the variable as-is

#### ✅ Canonical POS Expression:

```
F = (A + B) · (A’ + B’)
```

### 🔄 POS Shorthand Notation

Each Maxterm corresponds to the **binary representation of the row number** where F = 0:

| Maxterm | Input Combo (AB) | Binary | Decimal Index | Symbol |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------ |
| A + B   | 00               | 00     | 0             | M₀     |
| A’+B’   | 11               | 11     | 3             | M₃     |

Hence, using **Π (product) notation**, we can write:

```
F = ΠM(0, 3)
```

This is the **POS shorthand form**.

### ✅ Key Points

* **Product of Maxterms** is a canonical form where only Maxterms are used.
* It is used when focusing on **outputs that are false (F = 0)**.
* Each Maxterm is formed by **ORing all variables**, using:

  * **uncomplemented variable** if input is 0
  * **complemented variable** if input is 1
* Final expression is the **AND** of all such Maxterms.
* **POS Shorthand** is written as: `F = ΠM(indices of F=0)`
