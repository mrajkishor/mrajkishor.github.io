### ðŸ§© Microfrontend Design Approaches â€“ **When to Use What**

Understanding when to apply each microfrontend design approach is crucial to building scalable, maintainable, and high-performing frontend systems. Here's a breakdown of **when to use each approach**, based on real-world needs:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Horizontal Split**

> **Split the layout** into header, main, footer, etc., with each section handled by a separate microfrontend.

**âœ… Use When:**

* Your application has a **consistent layout structure** across all pages.
* Shared components like headers, footers, or sidebars need to be **reused across multiple routes**.
* You want to **separate teams by layout zones** (e.g., Navigation Team, Footer Team).

**ðŸš« Avoid When:** You need full **feature/domain isolation**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Vertical Split**

> Split by **features or domains**, e.g., Orders MFE, Cart MFE.

**âœ… Use When:**

* Teams are organized around **business capabilities** (Payments, Profile, etc.).
* Each team requires **full ownership** over their feature including routing, logic, and UI.
* Your application is **modular and scalable** (e.g., enterprise dashboards, multi-product apps).

**ðŸš« Avoid When:** Features are **highly interdependent** or too granular to isolate.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Component-Level Integration**

> Share and integrate individual components like `LoginButton`, `RatingWidget`, etc.

**âœ… Use When:**

* You have a **design system or shared component library**.
* You want to reuse components across multiple MFEs without duplicating code.
* Teams build **pluggable widgets** or **mini-tools**.

**ðŸš« Avoid When:** Components are **tightly coupled** with page logic or require **heavy coordination**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

> Align microfrontends and APIs with **business domain boundaries**.

**âœ… Use When:**

* You're building a **large, enterprise-scale application**.
* Your teams are domain-focused and follow **bounded contexts**.
* You want **end-to-end ownership** from frontend to backend (with BFF).

**ðŸš« Avoid When:** Your organization or product is **too small** to justify DDDâ€™s complexity.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Fragment-Based Rendering (ESI, SSR Chunks)**

> Compose UI by assembling **HTML fragments or SSR chunks** from multiple MFEs.

**âœ… Use When:**

* You want **server/edge rendering** for performance or SEO.
* Different teams deploy parts of the page independently.
* You need **independent fragment caching**, e.g., personalized cart but cached header.

**ðŸš« Avoid When:** You donâ€™t have a CDN that supports ESI or arenâ€™t using SSR frameworks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern**

> Each MFE has its **own backend** that aggregates and formats data.

**âœ… Use When:**

* Each MFE has **unique API needs** and business logic.
* You want to **decouple frontend from backend complexity**.
* You follow DDD and want **team-level autonomy** over APIs.

**ðŸš« Avoid When:** API logic is **too simple** to warrant dedicated BFFs.

| Goal / Scenario                               | Recommended Approach                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Reusable layout parts (e.g., navbar, footer)  | **Horizontal Split**                           |
| Feature/domain isolation (e.g., orders, cart) | **Vertical Split**                             |
| Shared UI elements across MFEs                | **Component-Level Integration**                |
| Business-aligned architecture                 | **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**                 |
| Edge rendering, SSR, and fragment caching     | **Fragment-Based Rendering (ESI, SSR Chunks)** |
| Custom data orchestration for each MFE        | **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern**         |
