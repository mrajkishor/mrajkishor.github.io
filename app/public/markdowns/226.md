# Understanding Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy approach used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. The MST is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices with the smallest possible total edge weight, without forming any cycles.

In this blog, we will explore the workings of Kruskal's Algorithm, its step-by-step implementation, alternative approaches, and analyze its time and space complexities.

## Key Features of Kruskal's Algorithm

1. **Edge-Based**: Unlike Prim's Algorithm, which is vertex-based, Kruskal's Algorithm focuses on edges.
2. **Greedy Strategy**: Selects the smallest edges first to ensure a minimal total weight.
3. **Cycle Detection**: Uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure to detect cycles efficiently.

### Applications:
- **Network Design**: Building efficient road, network, or pipeline systems.
- **Approximation Algorithms**: Solving NP-hard problems like clustering.

## Steps of Kruskal's Algorithm

1. **Sort All Edges**:
   - Arrange all edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.

2. **Initialize MST**:
   - Start with an empty MST.

3. **Add Edges**:
   - Iterate through the sorted edges.
   - Add an edge to the MST if it does not form a cycle.
   - Use a Union-Find data structure to check and prevent cycles.

4. **Repeat**:
   - Continue adding edges until the MST has \(V - 1\) edges, where \(V\) is the number of vertices.

## Implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm

### Graph Representation
We represent the graph as an edge list.

#### Java Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Edge implements Comparable<Edge> {
    int source, destination, weight;

    public Edge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
        this.source = source;
        this.destination = destination;
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    public int compareTo(Edge other) {
        return this.weight - other.weight;
    }
}

class UnionFind {
    private int[] parent, rank;

    public UnionFind(int size) {
        parent = new int[size];
        rank = new int[size];
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            rank[i] = 0;
        }
    }

    public int find(int u) {
        if (parent[u] != u) {
            parent[u] = find(parent[u]);
        }
        return parent[u];
    }

    public boolean union(int u, int v) {
        int rootU = find(u);
        int rootV = find(v);
        if (rootU == rootV) return false;

        if (rank[rootU] > rank[rootV]) {
            parent[rootV] = rootU;
        } else if (rank[rootU] < rank[rootV]) {
            parent[rootU] = rootV;
        } else {
            parent[rootV] = rootU;
            rank[rootU]++;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

public class Kruskal {
    public List<Edge> kruskalMST(List<Edge> edges, int vertices) {
        Collections.sort(edges);
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(vertices);
        List<Edge> mst = new ArrayList<>();

        for (Edge edge : edges) {
            if (uf.union(edge.source, edge.destination)) {
                mst.add(edge);
            }
        }
        return mst;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Edge> edges = new ArrayList<>();
        edges.add(new Edge(0, 1, 10));
        edges.add(new Edge(0, 2, 6));
        edges.add(new Edge(0, 3, 5));
        edges.add(new Edge(1, 3, 15));
        edges.add(new Edge(2, 3, 4));

        Kruskal k = new Kruskal();
        List<Edge> mst = k.kruskalMST(edges, 4);

        System.out.println("Edges in the MST:");
        for (Edge edge : mst) {
            System.out.println(edge.source + " - " + edge.destination + ": " + edge.weight);
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:
#### Graph:
```
   0 --(10)-- 1
   | \       |
  (6) (5)   (15)
   |     \   |
   2 --(4)-- 3
```
#### MST Output:
```
Edges in the MST:
2 - 3: 4
0 - 3: 5
0 - 1: 10
```

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. **Priority Queue for Edges**
Instead of sorting all edges upfront, use a priority queue to process the smallest edges first. This approach can be useful if the edge list is very large but can still fit into memory.

### 2. **Matrix Representation**
For dense graphs, edges can be represented using an adjacency matrix. However, Kruskal's Algorithm is typically more efficient with edge lists for sparse graphs.

---

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
1. **Sorting Edges**: \(O(E \log E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
2. **Union-Find Operations**: Nearly constant time, \(O(E \alpha(V))\), where \(\alpha\) is the inverse Ackermann function.

**Total Time Complexity**: \(O(E \log E + E \alpha(V))\).

### Space Complexity:
1. **Edge List**: \(O(E)\).
2. **Union-Find Data Structure**: \(O(V)\).

**Total Space Complexity**: \(O(E + V)\).

---

## Advantages of Kruskal's Algorithm
1. **Efficient for Sparse Graphs**: Performs well on graphs with fewer edges.
2. **Simple Cycle Detection**: Uses the Union-Find data structure effectively.
3. **Modular Implementation**: Sorting edges and processing them independently simplifies the implementation.

---

## Limitations of Kruskal's Algorithm
1. **Sorting Overhead**: Requires sorting of edges, which can be expensive for dense graphs.
2. **Global Perspective**: Processes edges globally, which may require large memory for very dense graphs.

## Example Execution for a Larger Graph
#### Input Graph:
```
   A --1-- B
   | \    /|
  (4) (3)(2)
   |   \  |
   C --5-- D
```
#### Edge List:
```
A - B: 1
A - C: 4
B - C: 3
B - D: 2
C - D: 5
```
#### Output:
```
Edges in the MST:
A - B: 1
B - D: 2
B - C: 3
```
