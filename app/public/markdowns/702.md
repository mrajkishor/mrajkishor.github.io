### üß© Building Microfrontend Apps / **Dynamic Remote Integration**

---

**Dynamic Remote Integration** in microfrontend (MFE) architecture refers to the ability to load remote microfrontend modules at **runtime** rather than statically bundling them during build time.

This is a powerful pattern that allows independent deployment, **dynamic feature rollout**, **lazy loading**, and **version control** of each microfrontend‚Äîenabling true frontend modularity.

---

## üöÄ What is Dynamic Remote Integration?

Instead of hardcoding remote URLs in Webpack‚Äôs `ModuleFederationPlugin` config, dynamic remote integration lets the **host (shell) app fetch and load MFEs on demand** using remote configuration.

This makes the host application:

* **Environment-aware** (load remotes per environment: dev/stage/prod)
* **Version-aware** (load remotes dynamically by version)
* **Deploy-safe** (no need to rebuild the host when a remote changes)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Traditional vs Dynamic Approach

| Static Remote Configuration                       | Dynamic Remote Integration                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Defined in `webpack.config.js`                    | Defined at runtime via dynamic script injection      |
| Requires host rebuild when remote changes         | Remote can be swapped/deployed independently         |
| Not suited for CI/CD independence                 | Perfect for microfrontend independence               |
| Example: `"remotes": { app1: "app1@http://..." }` | Example: load remote URL dynamically from config API |

---

## üß™ Example: Manual Dynamic Remote Loading

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Load RemoteEntry.js at Runtime

```ts
export function loadRemoteScript(url: string): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (document.querySelector(`script[src="${url}"]`)) {
      resolve();
      return;
    }

    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = url;
    script.type = 'text/javascript';
    script.async = true;

    script.onload = () => resolve();
    script.onerror = () => reject(`Failed to load ${url}`);
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  });
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Initialize Remote Container

```ts
async function initRemote(name: string, url: string, scope: string, module: string) {
  await loadRemoteScript(url); // Load remoteEntry.js

  // Initialize container
  await __webpack_init_sharing__('default');
  const container = (window as any)[name];
  await container.init(__webpack_share_scopes__.default);

  const factory = await container.get(module);
  return factory();
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Use Remote Component in React

```ts
const RemoteComponent = React.lazy(() => initRemote(
  "remoteApp",
  "https://remote.example.com/remoteEntry.js",
  "remoteApp",
  "./App"
));

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
      <RemoteComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

---

## üì¶ Webpack Dynamic Remotes (Official Syntax for Webpack 5+)

Webpack 5 supports **runtime remote resolution** via `__webpack_init_sharing__` and `__webpack_share_scopes__`, as shown above. There's also syntax using `remote -> promise`:

```js
// webpack.config.js
remotes: {
  remoteApp: `promise new Promise(resolve => {
    resolve(window.remoteApp);
  })`,
}
```

You can combine this with external config or environment detection.

---

## üîß Centralized Config Service (Optional)

To decouple deployment and runtime decisions, host apps can fetch MFE info (like remote URLs, versions, or fallback UIs) from a config API or `microfrontend.config.json`.

```json
{
  "remoteApp": {
    "url": "https://cdn.domain.com/mfe-remote/1.0.0/remoteEntry.js",
    "module": "./App"
  }
}
```

## üåê Real-World Use Case

| Scenario                           | Benefit                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Remote team deploys `cart` MFE v2  | Host loads v2 at runtime without rebuild              |
| A/B testing with new invoice MFE   | Switch remote URL based on user group                 |
| Progressive rollout of new feature | Serve new remote only to 10% users                    |
| Hotfix on production MFE           | Deploy patch as new remote URL and update config only |
