### 📘 **Fibonacci Heap – Advanced Heap Data Structure**

A **Fibonacci Heap** is a special type of **heap (priority queue)** that provides **amortized constant time** for many operations, making it highly efficient for **graph algorithms** like **Dijkstra** and **Prim**.

---

### ✅ **Key Features:**

* Stores elements in a **collection of trees** (not a single binary tree)
* Each tree follows **min-heap or max-heap property**
* Uses **lazy operations** — defers work until necessary
* Especially efficient for **decrease-key** and **merge (union)**

---

### 🧠 **Time Complexities (Amortized):**

| Operation     | Fibonacci Heap | Binary Heap |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Insert        | **O(1)**       | O(log n)    |
| Get Min       | O(1)           | O(1)        |
| Extract Min   | O(log n)       | O(log n)    |
| Decrease Key  | **O(1)**       | O(log n)    |
| Delete        | O(log n)       | O(log n)    |
| Merge (Union) | **O(1)**       | O(n)        |

### 🧱 **Structure:**

* **Root list**: A circular doubly linked list of heap-ordered trees
* **Min pointer**: Points to the minimum node
* Each node has:

  * value
  * parent
  * child pointer
  * degree (number of children)
  * mark (used in decrease-key)

---

### 🔄 **How It Works:**

1. **Insert** → Add to root list directly (no reordering)
2. **Extract Min** → Remove min node, move its children to root, then consolidate
3. **Decrease Key** → Cut node and move to root list (may trigger cascading cut)
4. **Merge** → Simply combine root lists (constant time)

---

### 📌 **Use Cases:**

* Graph algorithms that perform **frequent decrease-key** operations

  * Dijkstra's Algorithm with min-priority queue
  * Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

---

### ⚠️ **Limitations:**

* Complex to implement
* High constant factors → rarely used in practice unless performance is critical
