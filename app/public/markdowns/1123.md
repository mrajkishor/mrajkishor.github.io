Here are the **most commonly asked Java interview questions with answers** on **Exception Handling**, tailored for a **Java Full Stack Developer** with **7+ years of experience** (Wipro-level or Enterprise-style interviews):

---

### ✅ **1. What is Exception Handling in Java?**

**Answer:**
Exception handling is a mechanism to handle **runtime errors** so that the application does **not crash abruptly** and can handle errors gracefully.

Java uses **`try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`** keywords for this.

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Divide by zero");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleanup");
}
```

### ✅ **2. What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions?**

| Feature            | Checked Exception             | Unchecked Exception                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inheritance        | Extends `Exception`           | Extends `RuntimeException`                               |
| Compile-time check | Yes                           | No                                                       |
| Must be handled?   | Yes                           | Optional                                                 |
| Examples           | `IOException`, `SQLException` | `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` |

### ✅ **3. What is the use of `throw` and `throws` in Java?**

* **`throw`** is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or block.
* **`throws`** is used in the method signature to declare exceptions the method might throw.

```java
void readFile() throws IOException {
    throw new IOException("File not found");
}
```

---

### ✅ **4. Can you catch multiple exceptions in a single `catch` block?**

**Answer:**
Yes, since Java 7, you can catch multiple exceptions using a **multi-catch block**:

```java
try {
    // risky code
} catch (IOException | SQLException ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

Note: All exceptions in the multi-catch must be **unrelated types** (no parent-child relationship).

---

### ✅ **5. What is the purpose of the `finally` block?**

**Answer:**
The `finally` block contains code that **always executes**, whether an exception is thrown or not. It is typically used for **resource cleanup**.

```java
try {
    // logic
} catch (Exception e) {
    // handle
} finally {
    // always runs
}
```

---

### ✅ **6. What happens if both `catch` and `finally` blocks have return statements?**

**Answer:**
The `finally` block will **override** the `catch` return:

```java
public int test() {
    try {
        return 1;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return 2;
    } finally {
        return 3; // This is returned
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ **7. What is a custom exception? Why and how do you create it?**

**Answer:**
A **custom exception** is a user-defined exception for handling **domain-specific errors**.

```java
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

Use it to enforce business rules or validate input beyond standard Java errors.

### ✅ **8. What is the difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize()`?**

| Keyword      | Purpose                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `final`      | Used to declare constant, prevent overriding/inheritance   |
| `finally`    | Block that executes after try/catch                        |
| `finalize()` | Method called by GC before object destruction (deprecated) |

---

### ✅ **9. Can we have `try` without `catch`?**

**Answer:**
Yes, `try` can be used **with only `finally`**, though you must use at least one of `catch` or `finally`.

```java
try {
    // code
} finally {
    // cleanup
}
```

---

### ✅ **10. What is exception chaining?**

**Answer:**
Exception chaining is the practice of **wrapping a low-level exception inside a high-level exception** using the `Throwable` cause.

```java
throw new ServiceException("Service failed", new SQLException("DB error"));
```

Useful for preserving the **original cause** while providing **domain context**.
