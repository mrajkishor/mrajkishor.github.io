### **Understanding Read-Write Conflict (Unrepeatable Read Problem) in DBMS**

In database management systems (DBMS), concurrency is crucial for maintaining efficiency and enabling multiple transactions to operate simultaneously. However, concurrency introduces various problems, one of which is the **Read-Write Conflict**, also known as the **Unrepeatable Read Problem**.

This problem arises when a transaction reads a value, another transaction modifies that value, and the original transaction tries to reread it. The subsequent read may yield a different result, causing inconsistencies and potentially incorrect outcomes.

### **What is Read-Write Conflict?**

Read-Write Conflict occurs in situations where:
1. Transaction `T1` reads a value `V`.
2. Before `T1` completes, Transaction `T2` modifies `V` (either updates or deletes it).
3. When `T1` attempts to reread `V`, it sees a different value or no value at all, causing an unrepeatable read.

This conflict generally happens in **non-serializable schedules** or when using **read-committed isolation levels** that do not guarantee repeatable reads.

### **Example of Read-Write Conflict (Unrepeatable Read Problem)**

Consider the following scenario in a bank database with an account balance:

#### **Initial State**
Account Balance: **₹1000**

#### **Transactions**

- **Transaction T1 (Customer Inquiry):**
  1. Reads the account balance (`₹1000`).
  2. Later, attempts to reread the balance to confirm its consistency.

- **Transaction T2 (Funds Withdrawal):**
  1. Updates the account balance by deducting `₹500`.

#### **Execution Sequence (Non-Serializable Schedule)**

| Time | Transaction T1                | Transaction T2               |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| t1   | Reads balance: ₹1000          |                              |
| t2   |                               | Deducts ₹500 (balance: ₹500) |
| t3   | Rereads balance: ₹500         |                              |

#### **Result**
Transaction `T1` first reads the balance as `₹1000`. However, before `T1` can complete, `T2` modifies the balance to `₹500`. When `T1` rereads, it sees `₹500`. This inconsistency can lead to confusion or errors in the application logic.

### **Why is it a Problem?**
1. **Inconsistent Data:** The data read by a transaction does not remain stable, which can lead to incorrect decision-making or faulty results.
2. **Lost Integrity:** Applications relying on stable data during a transaction may malfunction.
3. **Violates Repeatability:** Transactions expect the data to remain the same during their execution unless explicitly modified by themselves.

### **Preventing Read-Write Conflict**

To avoid read-write conflicts, DBMS employs **isolation levels** and **locking mechanisms**. Here’s how it can be mitigated:

#### **1. Isolation Levels**
- **Repeatable Read Isolation:**
  Ensures that if a transaction reads a value, no other transaction can modify it until the reading transaction completes.
  
  - Example: Transaction `T2` will be blocked from modifying the account balance until `T1` completes.

- **Serializable Isolation:**
  Ensures complete isolation, where transactions appear as if they are executed sequentially. This prevents all conflicts, including unrepeatable reads.

#### **2. Locking Mechanisms**
- **Read Locks (Shared Locks):**
  When `T1` reads a value, a read lock is applied, preventing `T2` from modifying it until `T1` releases the lock.
  
- **Write Locks (Exclusive Locks):**
  When `T2` modifies a value, it applies a write lock, preventing `T1` from reading it until the modification is complete.

---

### **Example with Locking**

#### **Using Repeatable Read Isolation**

| Time | Transaction T1 (Read Lock)   | Transaction T2               |
|------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| t1   | Reads balance: ₹1000 (lock)  |                              |
| t2   | Rereads balance: ₹1000       |                              |
| t3   | Releases lock                | Deducts ₹500 (balance: ₹500) |

In this case, `T1` reads consistent data throughout its execution, and `T2` can only modify the balance after `T1` releases its lock.

### **Real-World Example**

#### **Online Shopping System**
- **Scenario:**
  - Customer `A` (Transaction T1) views the stock of an item as 10 units.
  - Before confirming the purchase, another customer `B` (Transaction T2) buys 5 units, reducing the stock to 5 units.

- **Issue:**
  If `T1` does not recheck the stock before confirming the purchase, it might allow `A` to buy more units than available, leading to stock inconsistencies.

- **Solution:**
  Use repeatable read isolation to ensure `T1` consistently sees the stock as 10 units until its transaction completes.

### **Conclusion**

Read-Write Conflicts, or Unrepeatable Reads, are common concurrency issues in DBMS that can lead to data inconsistencies. By using proper isolation levels like **Repeatable Read** or **Serializable** and implementing locking mechanisms, we can prevent such problems, ensuring data integrity and consistency in multi-transaction environments.
