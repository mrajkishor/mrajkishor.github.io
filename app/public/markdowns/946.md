### 🧪 Hands-On Guide: Launching an EC2 Instance Running Linux

In this practical exercise, we’ll walk through the process of launching a virtual Linux server using **Amazon EC2** via the **AWS Management Console**. This is one of the best starting points for anyone new to cloud computing or AWS services.

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Overview:

#### ✅ 1. Launching Our First Virtual Server

We’ll begin by spinning up our very first **EC2 instance**, which is essentially a virtual server hosted in the cloud. Using the **AWS Console**, this process is highly guided with a user-friendly interface.

During this process, we’ll:

* Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) — like **Amazon Linux 2** or **Ubuntu**
* Choose the instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier)
* Configure settings like storage, networking, and more

This is a foundational step in learning cloud infrastructure.

#### ✅ 2. Exploring EC2 Parameters at a High Level

You’ll get introduced to important configuration settings such as:

* **VPC/Subnet**: Where your instance resides in the network
* **Security Groups**: Define which ports (like SSH, HTTP) are open
* **Storage Volumes**: Attach virtual hard drives (EBS)
* **Key Pair**: A secure SSH login mechanism for your server

Understanding these options is crucial as they impact cost, performance, and security.

#### ✅ 3. Using EC2 User Data to Set Up a Web Server Automatically

One of the most powerful features we’ll explore is **EC2 User Data**, which lets us automate tasks at instance launch.

In this demo:

* We’ll use a **User Data script** to install a web server (like Apache or Nginx)
* The script runs **once**, at the very first boot
* This means as soon as the instance is launched, the server will already be up and running with your configuration — no manual setup required

For example, a simple User Data might:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
```

This will set up an Apache web server right after launch.

#### ✅ 4. Managing the Instance (Start / Stop / Terminate)

Finally, you’ll learn how to **control the lifecycle** of your instance:

* **Start**: Boot up a stopped instance
* **Stop**: Shut it down temporarily (without deleting data)
* **Terminate**: Permanently delete the instance (this cannot be undone unless backed up)

Knowing when and how to use these actions helps optimize cloud usage and costs.

### 📝 Summary

By the end of this hands-on activity, you’ll have:

* Created your first cloud-hosted Linux server
* Gained confidence in navigating EC2 settings
* Understood the power of automation through User Data
* Learned the basics of instance lifecycle management

This is a key milestone in your AWS learning journey and sets the stage for more advanced tasks like load balancing, scaling, and deployment automation.
