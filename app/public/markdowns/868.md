## 🧮 **Addition in Binary Number System**

---

### ✅ **Overview**

Binary addition works much like **decimal addition**, except it's based on **base 2**, using only **two digits: 0 and 1**. It is the fundamental operation in digital circuits and computer systems, where:

* `0` represents the **OFF** state (low voltage),
* `1` represents the **ON** state (high voltage).

### 🔢 **Binary Addition Rules**

Binary addition follows four basic rules:

| Binary Inputs | Result | Carry          |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| 0 + 0         | 0      | 0              |
| 0 + 1         | 1      | 0              |
| 1 + 0         | 1      | 0              |
| 1 + 1         | 0      | 1 (carry over) |

### 🧮 **Step-by-Step Example: Adding 101 + 101**

```
   101
+  101
-------
```

1. **Rightmost Column (1 + 1):**
   → Result: 0, Carry: 1

2. **Middle Column (0 + 0 + 1 carry):**
   → Result: 1, Carry: 0

3. **Leftmost Column (1 + 1):**
   → Result: 0, Carry: 1 (carried to a new leftmost digit)

```
Carry:    1
          101
       +  101
       --------
         1010
```

**Result:** `1010` (which is 10 in decimal)

### 🔁 **Binary Addition Using 1’s Complement**

In binary arithmetic, **1's complement** is a method used to represent and perform arithmetic on **negative binary numbers**.

* `0` = **Positive**
* `1` = **Negative**

---

### 📌 **Case 1: Positive Number > Negative Number**

Use the **1’s complement of the negative number**, add it to the positive, and **add the final carry** to the result.

#### Example:

Add `+1111` and `-1101`

1. Convert `+1111` as it is:
   → `01111` (with sign bit 0)

2. 1's complement of `1101`:
   → `10010`

3. Add:

   ```
     01111
   + 10010
   --------
     00001 (with carry 1)
   ```

4. Add carry:

   ```
     00001
   +     1
   --------
     00010
   ```

**Result:** `+0010` (Decimal: +2)

---

### 📌 **Case 2: Negative Number > Positive Number**

When the **negative number has the higher magnitude**, perform 1's complement and **do not add carry**. Instead, take **1’s complement of the result** and mark it negative.

#### Example:

Add `+1101` and `-1111`

1. 1's complement of `-1111`:
   → `10000`

2. Add with `1101`:

   ```
     01101
   + 10000
   --------
     11101 (no end-around carry)
   ```

3. Take 1's complement of result:
   → `00010`

**Result:** `-0010` (Decimal: -2)

| Operation | Result | Carry | Notes                     |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ------------------------- |
| 0 + 0     | 0      | 0     | Basic no-carry addition   |
| 1 + 0     | 1      | 0     |                           |
| 1 + 1     | 0      | 1     | Carry generated           |
| 1 + 1 + 1 | 1      | 1     | Result 1, carry continues |
