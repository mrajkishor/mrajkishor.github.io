### 💭 First, What Does “Vendor” Mean?

In Webpack terminology, **vendor** usually refers to **third-party libraries** you install from npm — like:

* `react`, `react-dom`
* `lodash`, `axios`, `moment`
* Any other code that’s not written by *you*

These libraries are used across your app, but rarely change — and they’re often **large**.

That’s where **vendor splitting** comes in.

### 🧠 What Is Vendor Splitting?

> Vendor splitting is a technique in Webpack to **separate third-party (vendor) code from your own application code** into a different bundle.

Instead of having everything packed into one big `main.js`, Webpack splits out something like:

* `vendor.js` (React, Lodash, etc.)
* `main.js` (your app code)
* `runtime.js` (Webpack’s runtime code)

This leads to **better caching** and **faster page loads** on repeat visits.

---

### 💡 Why Vendor Splitting Helps

* **Third-party code changes less often** than your app code
* So browsers can **cache the vendor bundle** longer
* When you make app changes, only the `main.js` changes — the browser skips downloading `vendor.js` again

This drastically reduces the amount of JS users re-download during updates.

### 🔧 How to Enable Vendor Splitting in Webpack

Webpack handles this via the `SplitChunksPlugin`, which is built into Webpack by default.

Here's a basic setup:

```js
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
    cacheGroups: {
      vendor: {
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
        name: 'vendors',
        chunks: 'all',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Let’s break that down:

* `test: /node_modules/` → looks for modules coming from `node_modules`
* `name: 'vendors'` → creates a separate `vendors.js` file
* `chunks: 'all'` → applies this to both sync and async chunks

---

### 📁 Output Example

With vendor splitting enabled, your `dist/` folder might look like this:

```
dist/
├── vendors~main.abc123.js   ← third-party packages (React, etc.)
├── main.def456.js           ← your application code
├── runtime~main.ghi789.js   ← Webpack's runtime code
```

---

### 🧪 Real World Impact

Without vendor splitting:

* A single `bundle.js` might be 1MB
* Even a small text change in your code could invalidate the whole cache

With vendor splitting:

* `vendors.js` is 600KB and cached long-term
* `main.js` is 100KB and changes frequently
* Your users only re-download what actually changed

---

### ✅ Best Practices for Vendor Splitting

1. **Always split vendors in production builds**
2. Use long-term **\[contenthash]** in filenames for caching:

   ```js
   output: {
     filename: '[name].[contenthash].js'
   }
   ```
3. Use `SplitChunksPlugin` with custom `cacheGroups` if needed
4. Optionally split out individual large packages (e.g., `react`, `lodash`) as separate chunks

| Concept             | Description                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Vendor Code         | Third-party libraries from `node_modules`   |
| Vendor Splitting    | Separates vendor code from app code         |
| Benefits            | Smaller app bundles, better browser caching |
| Webpack Feature     | Done via `SplitChunksPlugin`                |
| Common Output Files | `vendors.js`, `main.js`, `runtime.js`       |

### 🎯 Final Thought

> Vendor splitting is one of those **"set it and forget it"** Webpack optimizations that can make a **huge difference** in performance and caching.

Once configured properly, it just quietly keeps your app lean and your users happy — especially on repeated visits.
