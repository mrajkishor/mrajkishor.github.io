## üìå What are Connected Components?

In a graph, a **connected component** is a maximal group of vertices such that every pair of vertices is connected by some path.

* In **undirected graphs**, a connected component means all nodes are reachable from each other within that group.
* In **directed graphs**, we deal with **strongly connected components (SCCs)**.

---

## üéØ Problem Types That Use This Pattern

* How many connected components are there in the graph?
* Can you group islands / friends / computers / provinces?
* Does the graph contain **cycles**?
* Can you determine **if adding an edge would create a cycle**?
* Are two nodes in the same component?

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques to Use

### 1. ‚úÖ **DFS (Depth-First Search)**

Used for:

* Traversing each component
* Detecting cycles (especially in **undirected** graphs)
* Marking connected groups

```java
void dfs(int node, boolean[] visited, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
    visited[node] = true;
    for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            dfs(neighbor, visited, graph);
        }
    }
}
```

#### ‚ûï How to Count Connected Components

```java
int countComponents(int n, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            dfs(i, visited, graph);
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)**

Used for:

* Efficient component merging
* Cycle detection in **undirected graphs**
* Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm (for MST)

```java
int[] parent = new int[n];

void initialize() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = i;
}

int find(int x) {
    if (parent[x] != x) {
        parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // path compression
    }
    return parent[x];
}

boolean union(int x, int y) {
    int rootX = find(x);
    int rootY = find(y);
    if (rootX == rootY) return false; // cycle detected
    parent[rootX] = rootY;
    return true;
}
```

## üîÅ Cycle Detection by Graph Type

### üî∑ Undirected Graph

* **DFS**: If a neighbor is visited and not the parent, it's a cycle.
* **Union-Find**: If `find(x) == find(y)` for an edge (x, y), cycle exists.

### üî∑ Directed Graph

* **DFS with recursion stack**: If a node is revisited and is in the current recursion stack ‚Üí cycle.

```java
boolean hasCycle(int node, boolean[] visited, boolean[] inStack, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
    visited[node] = true;
    inStack[node] = true;
    for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
        if (!visited[neighbor] && hasCycle(neighbor, visited, inStack, graph)) return true;
        else if (inStack[neighbor]) return true;
    }
    inStack[node] = false;
    return false;
}
```

## üß† Time & Space Complexity

| Technique  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| DFS        | O(V + E)        | O(V)             |
| Union-Find | O(Œ±(N)) per op  | O(N)             |

> **Note**: Œ±(N) is the inverse Ackermann function, nearly constant.
