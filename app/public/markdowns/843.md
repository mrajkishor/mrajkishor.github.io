# âœ… Memory Technology and Optimisation

Memory technology and its efficient use are critical in achieving smooth performance in computing systems. Poor memory managementâ€”such as memory leaks, unnecessary memory block overwrites, or inefficient garbage collectionâ€”can lead to performance bottlenecks, program crashes, or system reboots. This note explores key aspects of **memory optimisation**, **modern memory hardware**, and practical strategies to improve **system RAM efficiency**.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Memory Optimisation?

Memory optimisation refers to the process of:

* **Reducing RAM usage** in software.
* **Preventing memory leaks** by ensuring proper allocation and deallocation.
* **Improving memory throughput** by managing access patterns and hardware-level enhancements.

### Why is it Important?

* Prevents **out-of-memory errors** and system crashes.
* Enhances **performance** and responsiveness.
* Reduces **latency** in memory-intensive tasks.
* Ensures better **power efficiency**, especially in mobile and embedded systems.

## ðŸ”¸ Memory Leaks and Heap Mismanagement

A memory leak happens when:

* A program allocates memory from the heap **but fails to release it**.
* Over time, the heap becomes fragmented and depleted.
* This leads to **high RAM consumption**, causing sluggish performance or crashes.

> âœ… Example: Web browsers like Chrome are infamous for memory leaks due to multiple tabs and heavy extensions running simultaneously.

### ðŸ”§ Best Practice:

* Use memory only when needed.
* Free memory explicitly in low-level languages like C/C++.
* Let garbage collection handle unused memory in managed environments (e.g., Java, Python) â€” but still write clean, memory-safe code.

## ðŸ”¹ Memory Monitoring and Cleanup Techniques

### 1. **Track Used Memory and Kill Idle Processes**

* **Task Manager (Windows)** or **Activity Monitor (macOS)** can show which processes consume high RAM.
* Manually terminate unnecessary background apps.

### 2. **Disable Startup Programs**

* Some apps automatically launch on system boot.
* Disable non-essential ones using `msconfig` (Windows) or System Preferences on macOS.

### 3. **Use Lightweight Browsers**

* Google Chrome, although fast, consumes significant RAM.
* Alternatives like **Brave**, **Firefox**, or **Edge** may use fewer resources.

### 4. **Keep Software Updated**

* Developers often include **memory performance improvements** in updates.
* Update OS, drivers, and applications regularly.

## ðŸ”¹ DRAM (Dynamic RAM) Optimisation

### 1. **Burst Transfers and Row Buffer Usage**

* DRAM arrays store large blocks of data (1024â€“4096 bits per row).
* Once a row is activated, **multiple column reads can be performed quickly** using the row buffer.
* Minimising row switching improves latency and throughput.

### 2. **Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)**

* Traditional DRAM was **asynchronous** â€” leading to wasted time syncing with the memory controller.
* SDRAM uses a **clock signal** to synchronize data transfer with CPU, improving **timing efficiency**.
* SDRAM allows **burst mode**: e.g., 8-word reads without resending address.

### 3. **Programmable Transfer Size**

* SDRAM modules often include a register to store transfer size (e.g., 16, 32, 64 bytes).
* Helps controller optimize data fetch without repeatedly providing commands.

## ðŸ”¹ GDDR: Graphics-Specific Memory

### What is GDDR?

Graphics Double Data Rate memory (GDDR) is a DRAM variant optimized for high-throughput graphical workloads, especially in **GPUs**.

| Version | Based On | Key Features                      |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| GDDR2   | DDR2     | Early high-speed support          |
| GDDR3   | DDR3     | Improved power efficiency         |
| GDDR5   | DDR3+    | Wide bus width, higher clock rate |
| GDDR6   | DDR4     | Faster data rates, lower power    |

### Key Characteristics:

* Wider memory interface (up to 384 bits).
* Clock speeds up to **16 Gbps**.
* Designed to handle **parallel data access** for shaders, textures, and framebuffer operations.

âœ… **Use Case**: High-performance gaming, machine learning inference, video rendering, and VR applications.
