#### 🔹 What are Props?

In React, **props** (short for **properties**) are **read-only inputs** passed from a **parent component to a child component**. They allow components to be **reusable** and **dynamic**, by supplying external data for rendering or logic.

Think of props like **function parameters**:
Just as functions accept arguments, components receive props.

#### 🔹 Basic Syntax

```jsx
const Greeting = (props) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
};

const App = () => {
  return <Greeting name="Alice" />;
};
```

* `App` is the parent.
* `Greeting` is the child.
* `name="Alice"` is a prop passed to `Greeting`.

---

#### 🔹 Destructuring Props

A cleaner syntax using **ES6 destructuring**:

```jsx
const Greeting = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```

---

#### 🔹 Multiple Props Example

```jsx
const Profile = ({ name, age, location }) => (
  <div>
    <p>Name: {name}</p>
    <p>Age: {age}</p>
    <p>Location: {location}</p>
  </div>
);

const App = () => (
  <Profile name="John" age={30} location="India" />
);
```

---

#### 🔹 Passing Functions as Props

Props can also be **functions**, enabling **child-to-parent communication**:

```jsx
const Button = ({ onClick }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>
);

const App = () => {
  const handleClick = () => alert("Button clicked!");
  return <Button onClick={handleClick} />;
};
```

---

#### 🔹 Passing Objects and Arrays

```jsx
const List = ({ items }) => (
  <ul>
    {items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>)}
  </ul>
);

const App = () => <List items={['React', 'Vue', 'Angular']} />;
```

---

#### 🔹 The `children` Prop

React automatically passes anything between opening and closing component tags as `props.children`.

```jsx
const Card = ({ children }) => <div className="card">{children}</div>;

const App = () => (
  <Card>
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>This is some content inside the card.</p>
  </Card>
);
```

---

#### 🔹 Props Are Immutable

Props are **read-only**. You **cannot and should not modify** them inside the child component.

```jsx
// ❌ Don't do this
props.name = "New Name"; // Error
```

Instead, use **state** inside the component if you need to manage or change values.

---

#### 🔹 Best Practices

✅ Use **destructuring** for cleaner syntax

✅ Always use **prop types** (or TypeScript types) in large apps

✅ Avoid **prop drilling** by using Context or global state

✅ Use **default props** to avoid undefined errors

---

#### 🔚 Summary

> Props are the **main mechanism for passing data** in React's component hierarchy. They promote **reusability**, **modularity**, and **clean architecture** by enabling parent-to-child data flow in a declarative way.

### Why props are immutable:

__Unidirectional Data Flow:__

> React relies on a unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows down from parent components to child components via props. Making props immutable enforces this flow and prevents unexpected modifications from child components. 

__Predictable State:__

> When props are immutable, you can be certain that the data passed to a component will not change unexpectedly. This predictability makes it easier to track the state and behavior of your application. 

__Debugging:__

> If props could be modified within a component, it would become significantly harder to debug issues, as the source of changes would be less clear. By keeping props immutable, you can be confident that any data manipulation is intentional and managed by the parent component. 

__Preventing Accidental Mutations:__

> Immutability helps prevent accidental modifications to props, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the component or its paren
