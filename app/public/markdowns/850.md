### ðŸ“˜ **Types of Pipeline Techniques in Computer Architecture**

Pipelining is a powerful method used in processor design to improve **instruction throughput** and **parallel execution**. In 1977, **Handler and Ramamoorthy** classified pipeline processors based on their operational characteristics and performance. Below are the **six key types of pipeline techniques**:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Arithmetic Pipelining**

**Purpose**: Designed to handle **high-speed arithmetic computations** (especially floating-point operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

**Characteristics**:

* Involves multiple **arithmetic logic units (ALUs)**.
* Operations are broken into sub-tasks and passed through stages.
* Common in **scientific computing** and **supercomputers**.

**Stages Example for Floating-Point Addition/Subtraction**:

1. Subtract exponents to align them.
2. Adjust mantissas accordingly.
3. Perform addition or subtraction.
4. Normalize the result.

**Examples**: Cray-1, Star-100, TI-ASC, Cyber-205.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Instruction Pipelining**

**Purpose**: Increases instruction throughput by **overlapping instruction execution stages**.

**Stages** typically include:

* IF (Instruction Fetch)
* ID (Instruction Decode)
* EX (Execute)
* MEM (Memory Access)
* WB (Write Back)

**Features**:

* Each instruction is split into multiple steps, each executed in a different stage.
* Enables **multiple instructions** to be in different stages at the same time.
* **Four-segment pipelines** are commonly used, often combining stages (e.g., ID + AG).

**Challenges**: Memory contention and varying stage durations may create stalls.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Processor Pipelining**

**Purpose**: Pipeline **entire processors** (rather than individual instructions).

**Mechanism**:

* The **output of one processor** becomes the **input for the next**.
* Each processor performs a dedicated stage of processing on a data stream.

**Example Features**:

* Multiple functional units (Instruction Memory, ALU, Register File, etc.).
* Instruction enters and exits the pipeline every clock cycle.
* Ideal **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) â‰ˆ 1** under optimal conditions.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Multifunction vs Unifunction Pipelining**

| Type                       | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unifunction Pipeline**   | Performs **one fixed operation repeatedly** (e.g., floating-point adder).      |
| **Multifunction Pipeline** | Can execute **multiple operations** either concurrently or at different times. |

**Unifunction Examples**:

* Cray-1 had 12 different unifunction units for scalar and vector operations.

**Multifunction Flexibility**:

* Allows sharing of pipeline stages across functions.
* More **versatile**, but **more complex** to design and schedule.

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Dynamic vs Static Pipelining**

| Type                   | Description                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static Pipelining**  | Each instruction **follows a fixed path**. One reservation table.               |
| **Dynamic Pipelining** | Instructions can **use multiple execution paths**. Multiple reservation tables. |

**Static Pipeline**:

* Consistent function per cycle.
* Efficient for uniform workloads.

**Dynamic Pipeline**:

* Supports **multiple instruction types**.
* Can adapt to variable execution needs.
* Used in modern **superscalar and out-of-order processors**.

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Vector vs Scalar Pipelining**

| Type                | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalar Pipeline** | Processes **one data element** per instruction.                |
| **Vector Pipeline** | Processes **multiple data elements** (vector) per instruction. |

**Scalar Example**: Intel 486
**Vector Example**: Cray vector processors

**Use Cases**:

* **Vector Pipelining**: Weather forecasting, genome sequencing, graphics rendering.
* **Scalar Pipelining**: General-purpose tasks where **data parallelism** is limited.

**Superscalar**: A hybrid where **multiple scalar instructions** are executed simultaneously.
