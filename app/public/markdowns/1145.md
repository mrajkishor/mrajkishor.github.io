# ✅ Spring Core: FactoryBeans and Custom BeanPostProcessors

In **Spring Core**, two powerful extension points are `FactoryBean<T>` and `BeanPostProcessor`. While most developers use the `@Bean` or `@Component` approach to define and manage beans, Spring allows deep customization of bean instantiation and post-processing pipelines—critical for building **frameworks**, **domain-specific containers**, and **dynamic proxying systems**.

---

## 🔷 Part 1: `FactoryBean<T>`

### ✅ What Is It?

`FactoryBean<T>` is a **special interface** that allows you to customize the logic used to produce *other beans*. Instead of registering a bean directly, you register a factory for the bean.

* It is a **factory-level abstraction**, not a simple object producer.
* Unlike a regular bean, the object returned by `getObject()` is what gets exposed to the application context.
* Frequently used in **frameworks**, **ORM proxies**, **dynamic beans**, or **integrations** (e.g., MyBatis, Hibernate `SessionFactory`, JPA `EntityManagerFactory`).

---

### ✅ Key Methods

```java
public interface FactoryBean<T> {
    T getObject() throws Exception;
    Class<?> getObjectType();
    boolean isSingleton();
}
```

### ✅ Behavior

* By default, Spring will return `getObject()` from the container.
* To access the `FactoryBean` itself, prefix the ID with `&`.

```java
MyService service = context.getBean("myService");   // Returns T (not FactoryBean)
MyServiceFactory factory = (MyServiceFactory) context.getBean("&myService");
```

---

### ✅ Use Cases

| Use Case                   | Description                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proxy Creation**         | Return dynamic proxies or decorated instances            |
| **Remote Stubs**           | Create RMI or web service stubs at runtime               |
| **ORM Factories**          | Return Hibernate/JPA session factories or DAOs           |
| **Complex Initialization** | Conditionally return objects with complex creation logic |

---

### ✅ Example

```java
@Component("customDate")
public class DateFactoryBean implements FactoryBean<Date> {
    @Override
    public Date getObject() throws Exception {
        return new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd").parse("2025-08-04");
    }

    @Override
    public Class<?> getObjectType() {
        return Date.class;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSingleton() {
        return true;
    }
}
```

```java
Date date = context.getBean("customDate", Date.class);     // Returns java.util.Date
DateFactoryBean factory = (DateFactoryBean) context.getBean("&customDate"); // Returns factory
```

---

## 🔷 Part 2: `BeanPostProcessor`

### ✅ What Is It?

`BeanPostProcessor` is a **low-level hook** into the Spring IoC container. It allows you to modify **any bean instance** *after* it is instantiated but *before* it is returned for use.

* Works on all beans—not just the ones you define
* A typical use case includes **decorating**, **proxying**, **injecting**, or **validating** beans after instantiation.

---

### ✅ Lifecycle Position

```text
Instantiation → populate → Aware interfaces → *BeanPostProcessor* → init methods → *BeanPostProcessor (afterInit)* → ready
```

### ✅ Interface

```java
public interface BeanPostProcessor {
    Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName);
    Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName);
}
```

* You can register multiple `BeanPostProcessor`s.
* Spring executes them in **registration order**.

---

### ✅ Common Uses

| Use Case                  | Description                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Custom Logging**        | Add logging wrappers or diagnostics                |
| **AOP Proxying**          | Auto-proxy certain beans based on type/annotations |
| **Annotation Processing** | Inject logic based on custom annotations           |
| **Validation Hooks**      | Validate beans during initialization               |

---

### ✅ Real World Examples

| Framework            | What It Does                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spring AOP           | Uses `ProxyProcessorSupport` to auto-proxy beans              |
| Spring Security      | Injects security filters via post-processors                  |
| Spring Cloud         | Creates load-balanced beans like `@LoadBalanced RestTemplate` |
| Spring Boot Actuator | Hooks management endpoints into other beans                   |

---

### ✅ Example: Custom Logging Decorator

```java
@Component
public class LoggerBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {

    @Override
    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String name) {
        if (bean instanceof ServiceInterface) {
            return Proxy.newProxyInstance(
                bean.getClass().getClassLoader(),
                bean.getClass().getInterfaces(),
                (proxy, method, args) -> {
                    System.out.println("Logging call to: " + method.getName());
                    return method.invoke(bean, args);
                });
        }
        return bean;
    }
}
```

## 🔷 Advanced Usage: Combining FactoryBeans and BeanPostProcessors

You can use `FactoryBean` to create a base proxy and `BeanPostProcessor` to decorate or chain proxies further.

### 🧠 Pro Tip

* `FactoryBean` controls *what* is created.
* `BeanPostProcessor` controls *how* it's wired up and finalized.

## 🔷 Differences Summary

| Feature                 | `FactoryBean<T>`                   | `BeanPostProcessor`                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Target Scope            | Specific bean definition           | All beans                                           |
| When Invoked            | During bean definition resolution  | After bean instantiation                            |
| Return Value            | Custom bean instance (`getObject`) | Possibly modified bean object                       |
| Access To Bean Metadata | Limited                            | Full access via `beanName` and `ApplicationContext` |
| Use Case                | Bean factories, proxies            | Proxy decoration, annotation processing             |

---

## 🔷 Interview-Worthy Gotchas

1. **`FactoryBean` returns object of type `T`, not the factory itself.** Use `&beanName` to get the factory.
2. **`postProcessAfterInitialization` runs after `@PostConstruct`, `afterPropertiesSet()`, or XML init-methods.**
3. **Order matters!** Implement `Ordered` or use `@Order` to control execution sequence.
4. **Not Aware of Proxies Yet:** In `postProcessBeforeInitialization`, beans might not yet be AOP-proxied.
5. **Misuse leads to bugs:** Avoid placing heavy logic in `BeanPostProcessor` unless necessary. Keep them deterministic.

---

## 🔷 Related Interfaces

* `SmartFactoryBean`: Exposes `isEagerInit()` to control early instantiation.
* `SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor`: Powerful interface used in Spring AOP.
* `InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor`: Allows field injection logic pre-init.
* `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`: Alters bean definitions **before** beans are created.

## 🔚 Summary

| Concept             | Why It Matters                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FactoryBean<T>`    | Custom instantiation logic, often used in framework internals |
| `BeanPostProcessor` | Modification or decoration of any Spring-managed bean         |
| Combined Power      | Build extensible, pluggable frameworks and dynamic behaviors  |

Mastering these concepts equips you to **build Spring-based infrastructure code**, not just use it. This is a common trait in Enterprise-level backend roles where **framework-level abstractions** are frequently crafted in-house.

## <ins>Use cases and Case studies</ins>


## ✅ Use Cases of `FactoryBean<T>`

### 1. **Dynamic Proxy Factory (AOP / Logging / Retry)**

* **Use Case**: You want to wrap services with dynamic proxies that add retry logic or logging behavior based on annotations.
* **Why FactoryBean**: You return a dynamic proxy from `getObject()` without touching service code.

### 2. **Multi-Tenant DataSource Factory**

* **Use Case**: In a multi-tenant SaaS, the `DataSource` must be chosen at runtime depending on the tenant ID.
* **Why FactoryBean**: You use `FactoryBean<DataSource>` to return a tenant-aware proxy that routes JDBC connections dynamically.

### 3. **Remote API Client Factory (e.g., Feign, gRPC)**

* **Use Case**: You need to dynamically construct clients for calling remote services (e.g., gRPC stubs or REST clients).
* **Why FactoryBean**: Generate and return the appropriate remote client implementation via configuration.

### 4. **JPA EntityManagerFactory or Hibernate SessionFactory**

* **Use Case**: Frameworks like Spring Data or Hibernate use `FactoryBeans` to expose SessionFactories configured via XML or JavaConfig.

---

## ✅ Use Cases of `BeanPostProcessor`

### 1. **@CustomTransactional Decorator**

* **Use Case**: You want to create your own `@CustomTransactional` annotation that wraps methods in custom transaction handling.
* **Why PostProcessor**: It inspects beans for the annotation and wraps them in AOP proxies dynamically.

### 2. **Audit Decorator for Services**

* **Use Case**: You want every service method call to emit an audit log *without* modifying service code.
* **Why PostProcessor**: You use a post-processor to scan for services and wrap them with audit-logging decorators.

### 3. **Custom Validation**

* **Use Case**: On every `@Component`, check if required fields are non-null or throw meaningful validation errors.
* **Why PostProcessor**: Allows enforcing rules after dependency injection but before runtime use.

### 4. **Dependency Injection for Non-Spring Beans**

* **Use Case**: In legacy systems, some beans are not Spring-managed but need field injection.
* **Why PostProcessor**: You hook into Spring lifecycle and inject dependencies manually using reflection or `ApplicationContext`.

## 📘 Case Study 1: Multi-Tenant Aware Service Using `FactoryBean`

### 🏢 Scenario:

A FinTech company uses Spring Boot for backend services. It supports multiple tenants and requires each tenant to have isolated service behavior and database configuration.

### 🎯 Goal:

Create a `ReportService` that dynamically resolves to the tenant-specific implementation at runtime.

### ⚙️ Solution:

Implement a `FactoryBean<ReportService>` that returns a proxy. Based on a ThreadLocal `TenantContext`, the proxy delegates to the correct implementation.

```java
public class TenantAwareReportServiceFactory implements FactoryBean<ReportService> {
    @Override
    public ReportService getObject() {
        return (ReportService) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
            ReportService.class.getClassLoader(),
            new Class[]{ReportService.class},
            (proxy, method, args) -> {
                String tenantId = TenantContext.getCurrentTenant();
                ReportService realService = ReportRegistry.getForTenant(tenantId);
                return method.invoke(realService, args);
            }
        );
    }

    @Override
    public Class<?> getObjectType() {
        return ReportService.class;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSingleton() {
        return false;
    }
}
```

### ✅ Result:

* Tenant isolation is achieved at runtime.
* Developers don't need to worry about the context-switching logic—it’s injected seamlessly.
* Works well with `@Autowired ReportService` across the app.

## 📘 Case Study 2: Auto-Wrapping Beans with Retry Logic Using `BeanPostProcessor`

### 🏢 Scenario:

An eCommerce platform wants to improve resilience. Backend service methods often call remote APIs (e.g., inventory, payment). Adding `@Retryable` logic manually is repetitive.

### 🎯 Goal:

Automatically wrap all `@RetryableService` beans with a proxy that retries the method call up to 3 times on failure.

### ⚙️ Solution:

Create a `BeanPostProcessor` that looks for `@RetryableService`, and uses dynamic proxy to wrap calls with retry logic.

```java
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface RetryableService {}

@Component
public class RetryPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {

    @Override
    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {
        if (bean.getClass().isAnnotationPresent(RetryableService.class)) {
            return Proxy.newProxyInstance(
                bean.getClass().getClassLoader(),
                bean.getClass().getInterfaces(),
                (proxy, method, args) -> {
                    int attempts = 3;
                    while (true) {
                        try {
                            return method.invoke(bean, args);
                        } catch (Exception ex) {
                            if (--attempts == 0) throw ex;
                            System.out.println("Retrying method: " + method.getName());
                        }
                    }
                });
        }
        return bean;
    }
}
```

### ✅ Result:

* Resilience increased without polluting service code.
* Retry logic is reusable and centralized.
* Composable with other post-processors (like logging or tracing).

---

## 📘 Case Study 3: Spring Boot Framework Auto Configuration using `FactoryBean` + `PostProcessor`

### 🏢 Scenario:

You're building a Spring Boot starter `@EnableFeatureX` that registers dynamic features (like custom messaging engines or metrics exporters) based on classpath detection or config.

### 🎯 Goal:

* Use `FactoryBean` to initialize features only if needed.
* Use `BeanPostProcessor` to hook into existing beans and inject feature hooks (e.g., observability decorators).

### ⚙️ Solution:

* Create `FeatureXFactoryBean` to produce a conditional bean.
* Implement `FeatureXBeanPostProcessor` to inject custom logic into eligible beans.

### ✅ Result:

You now have:

* A modular, pluggable feature.
* A lean runtime with only necessary beans loaded.
* Framework-like behavior built on standard Spring APIs.

### <ins>STAR 

Here are **Enterprise-level STAR-format stories** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for real-world use cases involving `FactoryBean<T>` and `BeanPostProcessor` in **Spring Core**. These are tailored for **interview storytelling** — concise, technical, and focused on **ownership**, **design decisions**, and **impact**.

---

## 🌟 STAR 1: `FactoryBean` for Multi-Tenant DataSource Routing

### ✅ **Situation**

At my previous company, we were building a multi-tenant SaaS analytics platform where each customer had isolated database instances. All services needed to dynamically connect to the right DB at runtime based on the incoming request’s tenant ID.

### ✅ **Task**

Design a centralized, reusable mechanism to return the correct `DataSource` per tenant without modifying each service or repository.

### ✅ **Action**

I implemented a custom `FactoryBean<DataSource>` that returned a tenant-aware proxy. This proxy intercepted calls and delegated to the appropriate tenant-specific `DataSource` from a centralized registry. The selection was based on a `ThreadLocal` `TenantContext` populated via an HTTP filter.

Additionally:

* The `FactoryBean` returned a singleton proxy that behaved like a per-tenant `DataSource`.
* I integrated Spring’s `RoutingDataSource` pattern internally but exposed only one bean to the context.

### ✅ **Result**

This eliminated the need for conditionals in services and avoided duplicate configurations. The `DataSource` bean was cleanly injected with `@Autowired`, and all tenant routing became seamless. It scaled to 50+ tenants with zero changes to business logic and reduced onboarding time for new tenants from 30 minutes to under 5 minutes.

---

## 🌟 STAR 2: `BeanPostProcessor` for Auto-Retry Logic on Remote Services

### ✅ **Situation**

In our order-processing microservice, several remote API calls (to inventory, shipping, payments) were failing intermittently. These failures were transient and needed retry logic, but developers were inconsistently implementing it.

### ✅ **Task**

Introduce a uniform retry mechanism across all service beans annotated with `@RetryableService` without rewriting or wrapping code manually.

### ✅ **Action**

I created a custom annotation `@RetryableService`, and built a `BeanPostProcessor` that scanned all beans for this annotation. For those, I wrapped them in a dynamic proxy that retried method calls up to 3 times on `IOException` or `TimeoutException`.

Key design decisions:

* Used `java.lang.reflect.Proxy` for interface-based services.
* Leveraged `ApplicationContextAware` to allow internal dependency lookups if needed.
* Ensured minimal performance overhead and logging transparency.

### ✅ **Result**

Service resilience improved significantly. The average failure rate of remote calls dropped by 80%, and developers no longer needed to write boilerplate retry code. This approach was later adopted across 4 other microservices and standardized via a shared internal Spring Boot starter.

---

## 🌟 STAR 3: `FactoryBean` for Dynamic gRPC Client Creation

### ✅ **Situation**

We migrated several REST-based internal services to gRPC for better performance and schema enforcement. However, setting up gRPC clients with channel configuration and stubs was tedious and error-prone.

### ✅ **Task**

Create a simplified mechanism where developers could just write `@Autowired MyGrpcClient client;` and get a fully wired gRPC client behind the scenes.

### ✅ **Action**

I implemented a `FactoryBean<T>` that auto-generated gRPC stubs based on a registry of known client interfaces. It dynamically created channels and returned the stub for each service.

Steps:

* Created a base `GrpcClientFactoryBean<T>` with type inference from generic parameters.
* Auto-registered client factories using `ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider`.
* Cached channel pools to optimize connections.

### ✅ **Result**

Developer onboarding time was reduced by 60%. All gRPC clients were now type-safe, consistent, and managed by Spring. This improved maintainability and reduced boilerplate across the platform.

---

## 🌟 STAR 4: `BeanPostProcessor` for Custom Metrics Injection

### ✅ **Situation**

In our observability revamp, the platform team wanted every service to emit custom Prometheus metrics like method invocation counts, failure rates, and latency without modifying business code.

### ✅ **Task**

Inject metric instrumentation into existing service beans automatically, including third-party services, using a non-invasive approach.

### ✅ **Action**

I created a `BeanPostProcessor` that used `ProxyFactory` to wrap eligible beans with advice interceptors. The proxy recorded:

* Invocation count
* Method duration using `Timer`
* Exception tags on failures

Used Spring AOP utilities to support both interface and class-based proxies. Added a feature toggle for local/dev environments to skip metric injection.

### ✅ **Result**

Within a sprint, over 80% of backend methods were emitting rich metrics without touching existing code. SREs used these metrics for alerting and SLA monitoring. It became a standard company-wide pattern and was later integrated into our Spring Boot base project template.

---

## 🌟 STAR 5: Framework-Like Plugin System with `FactoryBean` + `PostProcessor`

### ✅ **Situation**

We were building a plugin-based internal developer portal where features like secrets management, deployments, and monitoring were plug-and-play.

### ✅ **Task**

Enable features to register themselves declaratively, with custom beans injected or enhanced depending on the feature set enabled via config.

### ✅ **Action**

* Used `FactoryBean` to conditionally register feature clients or services.
* Wrote `BeanPostProcessor` to decorate existing service beans when a feature was enabled. E.g., `FeatureXPostProcessor` added interceptors only if `featureX.enabled=true`.
* Combined it with `EnvironmentAware` and `@Conditional` to avoid unnecessary initialization.

### ✅ **Result**

The platform became modular. Teams could enable features by flipping a property, and the appropriate beans and decorators would wire up automatically. This pattern reduced feature toggling complexity and allowed plugin authors to deliver independent feature modules.

## Code Sample 

Here are **Enterprise-level code samples** for each of the key use cases in our earlier STARs. These demonstrate real-world usage of both `FactoryBean<T>` and `BeanPostProcessor`, with clear patterns and full working structure.

                DataSource tenantDS = tenantDataSources.get(tenantId);
                if (tenantDS == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("No datasource for tenant: " + tenantId);
                return method.invoke(tenantDS, args);
            }
        );
    }

                (proxy, method, args) -> {
                    int attempts = 3;
                    while (true) {
                        try {
                            return method.invoke(bean, args);
                        } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
                            Throwable cause = e.getCause();
                            if (--attempts == 0 || !(cause instanceof IOException)) throw cause;
                            System.out.println("Retrying " + method.getName() + " due to: " + cause);
                        }
                    }
                }
            );
        }
        return bean;
    }
}
```

```java
// Sample usage

        // Could fail intermittently
        return "Available";
    }

## <ins> CIQnA


Here are **common interview questions and expert-level answers** related to **`FactoryBean<T>`** and **`BeanPostProcessor`**—suitable for **Enterprise-level Spring Core interviews**. These cover theory, internals, real-world applications, and common pitfalls.

---

## 🔷 Section 1: `FactoryBean<T>`

---

### ❓1. What is the difference between a normal bean and a FactoryBean in Spring?

**✅ Answer**:
A normal bean is instantiated directly and registered in the Spring container.
A `FactoryBean<T>` is a **special kind of bean** that **produces other beans**. When you register a `FactoryBean`, Spring calls its `getObject()` method and registers **the returned object** (of type `T`) as the actual bean.

To access the factory itself, you prefix the bean ID with `&`.
Example:

```java
context.getBean("myService");     // Gets T (product)
context.getBean("&myService");    // Gets FactoryBean<T> itself
```

---

### ❓2. When would you use a FactoryBean in a Spring application?

**✅ Answer**:
Use `FactoryBean` when:

* You want to dynamically create objects (e.g., proxy, stub, dynamic service)
* The construction logic is complex or depends on runtime data
* You’re integrating third-party tools that require dynamic initialization
* Examples: Hibernate’s `SessionFactory`, Spring AOP proxies, gRPC clients, JPA EntityManager

---

### ❓3. What happens if you declare a FactoryBean but forget to prefix with `&` when retrieving it?

**✅ Answer**:
Spring will return the **product object**, not the factory.
If you need to access configuration methods on the factory (like `getObjectType()`), you must use `&beanName`. Forgetting this can lead to `ClassCastException`.

---

### ❓4. Is the object created by a FactoryBean always a singleton?

**✅ Answer**:
No. It depends on the implementation of `isSingleton()` in your `FactoryBean`.
If it returns `true`, Spring caches the result of `getObject()` and returns it for every call.
If `false`, `getObject()` is called every time the bean is requested.

---

### ❓5. Can FactoryBeans be combined with annotations like `@Component` or `@Bean`?

**✅ Answer**:
Yes. You can:

* Annotate the FactoryBean class with `@Component`
* Or declare it with `@Bean` inside a `@Configuration` class:

```java
@Bean
public FactoryBean<MyClient> myClientFactory() {
    return new MyClientFactoryBean(...);
}
```

---

## 🔷 Section 2: `BeanPostProcessor`

---

### ❓6. What is a BeanPostProcessor and when is it invoked?

**✅ Answer**:
A `BeanPostProcessor` is an interface that allows custom logic to be executed **before and after** bean initialization.

It’s invoked:

1. After dependency injection (`@Autowired`, etc.)
2. Before and after `@PostConstruct`, `afterPropertiesSet()`, or `init-method`

Used for:

* Wrapping beans with proxies
* Injecting logic based on annotations
* Validating beans
* Logging, metrics, or tracing

---

### ❓7. What is the difference between `postProcessBeforeInitialization` and `postProcessAfterInitialization`?

**✅ Answer**:

* `postProcessBeforeInitialization`: Runs before `@PostConstruct`, `InitializingBean`, or `init-method`.
* `postProcessAfterInitialization`: Runs after all init logic—ideal for wrapping beans in proxies.

Only `postProcessAfterInitialization()` sees the fully initialized object ready for AOP or decorators.

---

### ❓8. How does Spring AOP use BeanPostProcessor internally?

**✅ Answer**:
Spring AOP registers a `BeanPostProcessor` called `AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator`.
This processor:

* Checks for `@Aspect` and proxyable beans
* Wraps eligible beans with dynamic proxies (`JDK` or `CGLIB`)
* Applies method interceptors for `@Around`, `@Before`, `@After` advice

So, AOP is entirely driven by post-processors under the hood.

---

### ❓9. Can you write multiple BeanPostProcessors? How are they ordered?

**✅ Answer**:
Yes, you can register multiple `BeanPostProcessor`s.
They are executed **in the order of registration**, unless:

* They implement the `Ordered` or `PriorityOrdered` interface
* Or annotated with `@Order(n)`

Spring uses this order to control decoration and dependency logic.

---

### ❓10. What is the difference between `BeanPostProcessor` and `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`?

**✅ Answer**:

| Feature                | `BeanPostProcessor`             | `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **When Invoked**       | After bean instantiation        | Before any bean is created                 |
| **Target**             | Bean instances                  | Bean definitions (`BeanDefinition`)        |
| **Use Cases**          | Proxies, decorators, validation | Modify bean metadata, dynamic registration |
| **Type of Processing** | Runtime (instance-level)        | Compile-time (definition-level)            |

---

### ❓11. What are some real-world libraries or frameworks that use BeanPostProcessor?

**✅ Answer**:

* **Spring AOP**: For creating proxies and applying advice
* **Spring Security**: For injecting filters and security wrappers
* **Spring Cloud**: To auto-configure load-balanced `RestTemplate`
* **Micrometer**: To add metrics instrumentation to beans
* **Lombok** (via Spring Boot dev tools): For injecting custom logic during init

---

## 🔷 Section 3: Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

---

### ❓12. What happens if your BeanPostProcessor modifies or returns null?

**✅ Answer**:
Returning `null` from `postProcessBeforeInitialization()` or `postProcessAfterInitialization()` causes Spring to skip that bean—essentially removing it from the context.
Use with caution. Generally, you should return the original bean unless you're wrapping it.

---

### ❓13. What are the risks of writing complex logic in `BeanPostProcessor`?

**✅ Answer**:

* **Hidden side effects**: Can affect lifecycle unpredictably
* **Circular dependencies**: If you try to inject other beans inside the processor
* **Performance**: Heavy reflection/proxying can slow startup time
* **Debugging complexity**: Unexpected runtime behaviors

---

### ❓14. Can BeanPostProcessors affect `FactoryBean`s?

**✅ Answer**:
Yes—but be careful. By default, `BeanPostProcessor`s affect the **product returned by `getObject()`**, not the `FactoryBean` itself.

If you want to process the `FactoryBean`, use:

```java
context.getBean("&myFactoryBean");
```

To process both, you must handle it explicitly by checking the bean name with `&`.

---

### ❓15. How do you test a FactoryBean or BeanPostProcessor?

**✅ Answer**:
For **FactoryBeans**:

* Write unit tests calling `getObject()` directly
* Assert the returned bean type and behavior

For **BeanPostProcessors**:

* Register the processor in a `@TestConfiguration`
* Load the `ApplicationContext`
* Verify wrapped behavior using mocks, method interceptors, or logs

```java
@Test
void testRetryableService() {
    MyService bean = context.getBean(MyService.class);
    assertDoesNotThrow(() -> bean.call());
}
```
