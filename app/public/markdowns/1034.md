## 🔹 1. **What is Linear Search?**

**Linear Search** is the **simplest searching algorithm**, used to find a target element in a list or array by **sequentially checking each element one by one** from left to right.

> ✅ It does **not require the array to be sorted**.

---

### ✅ Real-Life Analogy:

Searching for a phone number in a **randomly shuffled contact list** — you scan one name at a time until you find it.

---

## 🔹 2. **Linear Search Algorithm Logic**

```python
def linear_search(arr, key):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == key:
            return i  # found
    return -1  # not found
```

---

### 📌 Key Characteristics:

* **Unsorted Input** is allowed
* Works on **arrays, lists, strings**
* Stops on **first occurrence**
* Can be modified to **find all occurrences**

## 🔹 3. **Time and Space Complexity**

| Case         | Comparisons                       | Time Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Best Case    | 1 (element at index 0)            | **O(1)**        |
| Worst Case   | n (element at end or not present) | **O(n)**        |
| Average Case | ≈ n/2 comparisons                 | **O(n)**        |
| Space        | No extra space                    | **O(1)**        |

> For a large dataset, linear search is **inefficient** compared to binary search (O(log n)), but it's **universally applicable**.

## 🔹 4. **When to Use Linear Search**

| Condition                        | Why Linear Search?                      |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Data is **unsorted** or messy    | Binary search requires sorted data      |
| List is **very small**           | No performance benefit in binary search |
| One-time search, not repeated    | Fast to implement and run               |
| Need to find **all occurrences** | Easily extendable in linear scan        |

---

## 🔹 5. **Linear Search on Strings**

```python
def find_char(s, target):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

---

## 🔹 6. **Modified Variants**

### ✅ a) Search All Indices

```python
def find_all(arr, key):
    return [i for i in range(len(arr)) if arr[i] == key]
```

### ✅ b) Case-Insensitive Search (Strings)

```python
def linear_search_case_insensitive(arr, key):
    key = key.lower()
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i].lower() == key:
            return i
    return -1
```

## 🔹 7. **GATE DA Focus Areas**

| What GATE Tests                        | Example                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Algorithm trace (dry-run)              | Given input array + key, return index |
| Time complexity in best/worst/avg case | Analyze behavior with inputs          |
| Space efficiency                       | No recursion, no extra space          |
| Output correctness                     | First match vs all matches            |

## 🧪 GATE-Level MCQs

### Q1. Given `arr = [4, 2, 9, 1]`, what is the output of:

```python
linear_search(arr, 9)
```

✅ Output: `2`

### Q2. What is the time complexity of linear search in the **worst case**?

**A.** O(1)
**B.** O(log n)
**C.** O(n)
**D.** O(n log n)

✅ **Answer:** C

---

### Q3. When is linear search preferred over binary search?

**A.** Data is sorted
**B.** Data is unsorted
**C.** Binary search is always better
**D.** None

✅ **Answer:** B

---

### Q4. In an array of 10 elements, how many comparisons (maximum) will linear search make to find an absent element?

✅ **Answer:** 10

## 🔍 Summary Table

| Feature         | Linear Search          |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Input Type      | Any (sorted/unsorted)  |
| Time Complexity | O(n)                   |
| Space           | O(1)                   |
| Stable?         | Yes (first occurrence) |
| Direction       | Typically left → right |

---

## ✅ Final Notes for GATE DA

* Practice dry-run style problems: Given a key and array, show how many comparisons happen.
* Be aware that **linear search is universal**, while **binary search needs sorted input**.
* Most GATE DA questions will focus on **logic clarity** and **complexity analysis** — not implementation.
