## üìå Introduction

Uninformed search (also called **blind search**) refers to search strategies that **do not have any domain-specific knowledge** about the goal state beyond the problem definition. These algorithms explore the search space without any heuristic guidance.

## üéØ Characteristics of Uninformed Search

* No additional information beyond the problem statement.
* Systematically explores nodes until a solution is found.
* Guarantees completeness and optimality in some cases.
* Typically slower than informed (heuristic) methods.

## üß≠ Common Uninformed Search Algorithms

### 1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

* **Strategy**: Explores all nodes at a given depth before moving to the next level.
* **Data Structure**: Queue (FIFO)
* **Completeness**: Yes
* **Optimality**: Yes (if cost = 1 per step)
* **Time Complexity**: O(b^d)
* **Space Complexity**: O(b^d)

Where:

* `b` = branching factor
* `d` = depth of the shallowest goal node

---

### 2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

* **Strategy**: Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.
* **Data Structure**: Stack (LIFO) or recursion
* **Completeness**: No (can get stuck in infinite depth)
* **Optimality**: No
* **Time Complexity**: O(b^m)
* **Space Complexity**: O(bm)

Where:

* `m` = maximum depth of the search tree

---

### 3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**

* **Strategy**: Expands the node with the **lowest path cost** (`g(n)`)
* **Data Structure**: Priority Queue
* **Completeness**: Yes
* **Optimality**: Yes (for positive costs)
* **Time/Space Complexity**: O(b^(1 + C\*/Œµ))

Where:

* `C*` = cost of the optimal solution
* `Œµ` = minimum cost of any action

---

### 4. **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**

* **Strategy**: DFS with a pre-set depth limit
* **Completeness**: No (if limit < depth of solution)
* **Optimality**: No
* **Use Case**: Avoids infinite loops in DFS

---

### 5. **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**

* **Strategy**: Repeatedly applies DLS with increasing depth limits
* **Completeness**: Yes
* **Optimality**: Yes (if step cost = 1)
* **Time Complexity**: O(b^d)
* **Space Complexity**: O(bd)

‚úÖ Combines the space efficiency of DFS with the completeness of BFS.

## üí° When to Use Uninformed Search?

* When no heuristic information is available
* As a baseline before optimizing with informed strategies
* In educational settings to understand the foundations of AI search

## üß† Final Thoughts

While uninformed search methods may not always be efficient, they are **essential to understanding core search mechanisms** in AI. They lay the groundwork for informed search techniques like A\*, which build on these fundamentals with added heuristics.
