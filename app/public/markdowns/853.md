### 📘 **Throughput and Speedup of Pipelining – Detailed Note**

Pipelining enhances processor performance by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. To evaluate the **effectiveness** of pipelining, key performance metrics such as **throughput**, **latency**, **average instruction execution time**, and **speedup** are considered.

---

### 🚀 **1. Throughput**

**Definition**:
Throughput refers to the number of **instructions completed per unit time** (typically per second or per clock cycle).

#### ✅ **Key Points:**

* In a pipelined system, the **ideal throughput** is one instruction per clock cycle after the pipeline is fully loaded.
* The **maximum parallelism** depends on the number of **pipeline stages** and the number of **tokens** (instructions in flight).
* **Throughput is limited** by:

  * The **slowest stage** in the pipeline.
  * The **I/O bandwidth** for memory access (especially in text/data processing tasks).
  * The **size of sub-tasks or windows** processed per stage.

#### 📌 Example:

If the slowest pipeline stage takes 5 ns, the **maximum throughput** is one instruction every 5 ns.

---

### 🕒 **2. Latency**

**Definition**:
Latency is the **total time taken by one instruction** to pass through all pipeline stages.

#### 🧮 **Formula:**

```
Latency = Number of Pipeline Stages (m) × Clock Cycle Time (T)
```

#### 🔁 Characteristics:

* Latency increases with pipeline depth.
* More hazards, branches, or stalls lead to **higher latency**.
* **Latency ≠ throughput**: even if latency is high, throughput can still be optimized with more instructions in the pipeline.

### ⏱️ **3. Average Execution Time per Instruction**

This measures how long, **on average**, one instruction takes to execute in a pipelined system.

#### 🧮 **Formula:**

```
Average Instruction Execution Time = (Time per Instruction in Non-Pipelined Machine) / (Number of Pipeline Stages)
```

This assumes ideal conditions—no stalls, hazards, or overheads.

---

### ⚡ **4. Speedup**

**Definition**:
Speedup is a measure of how much **faster** a pipelined system performs compared to a non-pipelined system.

#### 🧮 **Formula:**

```
Speedup = Execution Time (Non-Pipelined) / Execution Time (Pipelined)
```

In the ideal case (no pipeline hazards, perfect balance), **maximum theoretical speedup** is equal to the **number of pipeline stages (m)**.

#### 🔍 In Practice:

Due to **data hazards**, **control hazards**, and **structural delays**, actual speedup is **less than ideal**.

### 📉 **Factors That Limit Speedup**

| Factor                           | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pipeline Hazards**             | Data dependencies and control flow changes (branches) can introduce stalls. |
| **Instruction Variability**      | Different instructions might require more/less time in certain stages.      |
| **Memory Bottlenecks**           | Access to memory may not match the speed of the pipeline.                   |
| **Cache Misses**                 | May introduce delays that ripple through the pipeline.                      |
| **Sub-optimal Task Granularity** | Tasks too small → overhead dominates; too large → poor cache performance.   |

---

### 📌 **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction)**

* CPI is a key performance metric used to evaluate pipeline efficiency.
* **Ideal CPI = 1** in a perfectly pipelined CPU.
* Real CPI is usually **>1** due to stalls, hazards, and branch mispredictions.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

Pipelining **greatly increases throughput** and **reduces average execution time** per instruction, though **latency for a single instruction increases**. The **overall speedup** depends on how well hazards are mitigated and stages are balanced. By optimizing pipeline depth, managing hazards, and fine-tuning task granularity, designers can get close to the **theoretical maximum performance**.
