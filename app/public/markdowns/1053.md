### Topological Sort Based Shortest Path

---

## üöÄ Introduction

The **Topological Sort based Shortest Path algorithm** is used to find the **single-source shortest path in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**. It leverages the fact that a DAG has no cycles, allowing us to process vertices in a **linear order** that respects dependencies.

This method is **more efficient than Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford** when the graph is a DAG.

---

## üîç When to Use

* Graph is **directed and acyclic**
* All weights are **non-negative or arbitrary**
* You want a **fast and efficient** solution: **O(V + E)**

---

## üß† Core Idea

Topological sort gives a **linear ordering** of vertices such that for every directed edge `u ‚Üí v`, vertex `u` comes before `v`.

This property helps in processing each vertex **only once**, updating distances in a correct sequence.

---

## üßæ Algorithm

### Input:

* A **DAG** with `V` vertices and `E` edges
* A **source** vertex `src`

### Output:

* Shortest distances from `src` to all other vertices

---

### Steps:

1. **Topological Sort** the DAG (can be done using DFS)
2. Initialize:

   * Distance array `dist[V]` with all values as `‚àû`
   * Set `dist[src] = 0`
3. Traverse the vertices in **topological order**:

   * For each vertex `u`, check all its adjacent vertices `v`
   * If `dist[u] + weight(u‚Üív) < dist[v]`, update `dist[v]`

---

### üîß Pseudocode

```python
def shortest_path_DAG(adj, V, src):
    topo_order = topological_sort(adj, V)
    dist = [float('inf')] * V
    dist[src] = 0

    for u in topo_order:
        for v, wt in adj[u]:
            if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + wt < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + wt
    return dist
```

> **Note**: `adj` is an adjacency list where `adj[u] = [(v1, w1), (v2, w2)]`
> Topological sort can be done via **DFS or Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm**

---

## üß™ Example

### Graph:

```
0 ‚Üí 1 (weight = 2)
0 ‚Üí 4 (weight = 1)
1 ‚Üí 2 (weight = 3)
4 ‚Üí 2 (weight = 2)
2 ‚Üí 3 (weight = 6)
```

### Topological Order: `0, 4, 1, 2, 3`

### Source: `0`

### Shortest Distances:

```
dist[0] = 0
dist[1] = 2
dist[4] = 1
dist[2] = 3
dist[3] = 9
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value    |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Time Complexity  | O(V + E) |
| Space Complexity | O(V)     |

> Much faster than **O(V log V + E)** in Dijkstra when graph is a DAG.

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Topological Sort Algorithm | DFS + Stack or Kahn‚Äôs Algo            |
| Edge Relaxation Order      | Follow topological order              |
| Graph Type                 | Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) only     |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* Only valid for **DAGs**
* Won‚Äôt detect cycles ‚Äî must be ensured beforehand
* Not applicable to graphs with cycles (use Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford instead)
