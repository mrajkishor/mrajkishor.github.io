## 🧮 Print 1 to N Using Recursion – Explained with 3 Approaches

In this post, we’ll explore how to **print or sum numbers from 1 to N** using **recursive techniques**, covering different programming styles in **JavaScript and Java**.

Let’s solve the problem step-by-step using three different approaches:

---

### ✅ Problem Statement

> Given a number `N`, write a program to calculate the **sum of numbers from 1 to N** using recursion.

---

## 🔹 Approach 1: Recursion with Global Variable (JavaScript)

This is the simplest style: using a **global `sum` variable** to accumulate results during recursive calls.

```javascript
let sum = 0;

function sumUptoN(n) {
  if (n > 100) return;   // base condition
  sum += n;              // accumulate
  sumUptoN(++n);         // recursive call
}

sumUptoN(0);
console.log("sum:", sum); // Output: sum: 5050
```

### 🔍 How it works:

* We keep adding `n` to a global variable `sum`.
* The function calls itself with `n + 1` until it reaches 101.

📌 **Note**: This approach relies on external state (`sum`) which is not recommended in real-world functional recursion, but good for understanding basics.

---

## 🔹 Approach 2: Pure Recursion with Return (Tail Recursive Style)

This approach avoids global variables and uses **function parameters** to pass the intermediate sum, making it cleaner and functional.

```javascript
function sumUptoN(n, sum) {
  if (n === 100) return sum + n;
  return sumUptoN(n + 1, sum + n);
}

const result = sumUptoN(0, 0);
console.log("sum:", result); // Output: sum: 5050
```

### 🔍 Why this is better:

* No side effects (no global state).
* Cleaner and easier to test.
* This is **tail-recursive**, meaning some JS engines can optimize it.

---

## 🔹 Approach 3: Mathematical Formula (Java)

The fastest and cleanest solution is to use the **formula for sum of first N natural numbers**:

$$
\text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfFirstN(int n) {
        return n * (n + 1) / 2;
    }
}
```

### ✅ Why use this:

* Time Complexity: `O(1)`
* No recursion needed.
* Most efficient and elegant for large values of `n`.

## 🚀 Conclusion

| Approach        | Time Complexity | Extra Space | Remarks                        |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Global Variable | O(N)            | O(N)        | Easy but impure                |
| Tail Recursion  | O(N)            | O(N)        | Cleaner and functional         |
| Formula-Based   | O(1)            | O(1)        | Best performance, no recursion |

Choose your approach based on the goal:

* Learning recursion? Try **Approach 1 or 2**.
* Solving it in real-world or interviews? Use **Approach 3**.

Here are **additional (less common)** variants you could optionally try:

### 🔄 Optional Additional Approaches (Advanced or Educational):

#### 🔹 4. **Head Recursion (from N to 1)**

Calls first, adds after return.

```javascript
function sumUptoN(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 0;
  return n + sumUptoN(n - 1);
}
console.log(sumUptoN(100)); // 5050
```

* Works by adding after recursive calls return.
* Not tail-recursive.

---

#### 🔹 5. **Using ES6 Generators + Recursion (educational only)**

```javascript
function* generateSum(n) {
  if (n > 0) {
    yield* generateSum(n - 1);
    yield n;
  }
}

let sum = 0;
for (const num of generateSum(100)) sum += num;
console.log(sum); // 5050
```
