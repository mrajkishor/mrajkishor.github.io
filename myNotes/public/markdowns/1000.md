## 🔐 **2PL, Locking, and Timestamp Ordering**

---

Concurrency control ensures that transactions execute **safely and correctly in a concurrent environment**. Two of the most important concurrency control methods tested in GATE are:

* **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**
* **Timestamp Ordering (TO)**

Let’s understand them in depth.

---

## 🔒 1️⃣ Two-Phase Locking (2PL)

### 🔹 What is 2PL?

> A concurrency control protocol that ensures **conflict serializability** by enforcing a two-phase rule for lock acquisition and release.

---

### 🔄 Two Phases:

1. **Growing Phase**:

   * A transaction may **acquire** locks
   * Cannot release any lock

2. **Shrinking Phase**:

   * A transaction may **release** locks
   * Cannot acquire new locks

📌 Once a transaction **starts releasing** any lock, it **can’t obtain more locks**.

---

### 🔐 Lock Types:

| Lock Type              | Meaning                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared Lock (S)**    | For reading only (others can also read)              |
| **Exclusive Lock (X)** | For writing (no other transaction can read or write) |

---

### ✅ Why 2PL is Important

* Guarantees **conflict-serializability**
* **Does NOT guarantee freedom from deadlocks**
* Used in real-world DBMS like MySQL (InnoDB) and Oracle

### 🔁 Variants of 2PL

| Variant              | Description                                 | GATE Relevance                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Strict 2PL**       | All locks held till commit/abort            | Prevents cascading rollbacks ✅   |
| **Rigorous 2PL**     | Holds all locks until commit (even S locks) | Ensures strict serializability ✅ |
| **Conservative 2PL** | Takes all locks before transaction begins   | Deadlock-free ❗ Rare in GATE     |

---

## ⚠️ Deadlock in 2PL

If two transactions **wait for each other’s locks**, we get a **deadlock**.

📌 **Example**:

* T1 locks X and wants Y
* T2 locks Y and wants X

Both wait forever ⇒ deadlock

🛠️ **Solutions**:

* Wait-Die and Wound-Wait schemes
* Timeout detection
* Wait-for graph

## 🕒 2️⃣ Timestamp Ordering (TO)

### 🔹 What is Timestamp Ordering?

> A **non-locking** concurrency control protocol that uses **timestamps** to order transactions **logically**.

Each transaction is assigned a unique **timestamp (TS)** when it starts. This determines its **serialization order**.

---

### 🔑 Rules:

Each data item `X` has two timestamps:

* `read_TS(X)` → largest TS of any transaction that read X
* `write_TS(X)` → largest TS of any transaction that wrote X

📜 For a transaction T with `TS(T)`:

| Operation    | Rule                                                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read(X)**  | If `TS(T) < write_TS(X)`: ❌ **Abort** T (T is too old)                                  |
| **Write(X)** | If `TS(T) < read_TS(X)` or `TS(T) < write_TS(X)`: ❌ **Abort** T (violates serial order) |

If no conflict: ✅ allow operation and update the timestamp.

| Serializability Type | **Conflict-serializable**                           |
| Starvation?          | ❗Yes, older transactions may get aborted repeatedly |

| Concept                | Description                           | Guarantees                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **2PL**                | Locks used; growing + shrinking phase | Conflict serializability         |
| **Strict 2PL**         | All locks released after commit       | Serializability + Recoverability |
| **Timestamp Ordering** | No locks; ordered by timestamps       | Conflict serializability         |

## 🧪 Example: 2PL Locking

**T1**: R(X), W(X), R(Y), W(Y)
**T2**: R(Y), W(Y), R(X), W(X)

If locks are acquired in order:

* T1 acquires X → T2 waits for X
* T1 then requests Y (but T2 already holds Y)
  → **Deadlock occurs**
