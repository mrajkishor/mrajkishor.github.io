## 🧠 **Importance of Memory Organisation**

### 📘 **What is Memory Organisation?**

In the context of businesses and institutions, **memory organisation** refers to the structured way in which a company stores, retrieves, and utilizes its **collective knowledge and experiences**. This includes both **tangible data** (documents, databases, manuals) and **intangible knowledge** (skills, experiences, and unwritten know-how of employees).

Organisational memory serves as a **repository of accumulated wisdom**, enabling better decision-making, continuity, and learning over time.

   * Employee experiences and expertise
   * Tacit knowledge from years of working
   * Personal networks and relationships
   * Lessons learned from handling specific challenges
