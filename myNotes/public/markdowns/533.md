# 🚀 Deploying a PWA with Next.js  

## 🧭 Introduction

After turning your Next.js app into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** with offline support, manifest configuration, and service worker integration, the final and crucial step is **deploying it correctly**.

Since PWAs rely on HTTPS, proper caching headers, and public access to static files like the manifest and icons, your deployment setup must align with these requirements.

This blog covers how to deploy your **Next.js PWA** to popular hosting providers like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, and **custom servers**, and the checklist to ensure it works seamlessly as a true installable app.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Ensure you’ve already:
- Configured `next-pwa` in `next.config.js`
- Added a `manifest.json` and icons in the `public/` folder
- Set up a custom `sw.js` service worker if needed
- Enabled production build (`npm run build`)

---

## ⚙️ Deployment Options

### ✅ 1. **Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)**

Vercel is the official platform for Next.js and supports `next-pwa` out of the box.

#### Steps:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your GitHub repo
4. Set `NODE_ENV=production` and add:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=...
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=...
   ```
5. Click **Deploy**

📌 **Note**:
- Ensure `disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` is set in `next-pwa`
- Vercel automatically handles **HTTPS**, **caching**, and **static file hosting**

### ✅ 2. **Netlify**

Netlify is another great choice for hosting Next.js PWAs.

#### Steps:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Login to [https://netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Select your repo and configure the build command:
   ```
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: .next
   ```

4. Add the following headers in a `_headers` file in `public/`:

```
/sw.js
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate
```

📌 Netlify needs a plugin like `next-on-netlify` for advanced support with SSR + SW.

### ✅ 3. **Custom Node.js Server (e.g., Express)**

You can also deploy your app manually using Node.js + Express on a VPS or cloud VM.

#### Steps:
1. Install `next`, `express`, and `serve-static`
2. Create `server.js`:

```js
const express = require('express');
const next = require('next');
const path = require('path');

const app = next({ dev: false });
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

app.prepare().then(() => {
  const server = express();

  server.use('/sw.js', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '.next/static/sw.js')));

  server.all('*', (req, res) => {
    return handle(req, res);
  });

  server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server ready on http://localhost:3000'));
});
```

3. Run with:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production node server.js
```

✅ HTTPS must be enabled via Nginx or Let's Encrypt in production.

## 🔍 PWA Deployment Checklist

✅ `manifest.json` is accessible at `/manifest.json`  
✅ `sw.js` is served with correct cache headers  
✅ `icon-192x192.png` and `icon-512x512.png` exist in `/public/icons/`  
✅ App is served via **HTTPS**  
✅ `next-pwa` is **enabled only in production**  
✅ `serviceWorker` is **registered properly**  
✅ Test with Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse > PWA score  
✅ You see **“Install App”** option in browser menu or prompt

---

## 🧪 Testing Your PWA

Use Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse tab to test:

- PWA installability
- Offline support
- Manifest & icon availability
- Service Worker registration

✅ Your app should score **100** on the PWA audit for best practices.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Use **custom offline fallback** in case network fails
- Keep static assets in `public/` to make them easily cacheable
- Use `register: true`, `skipWaiting: true` in `next-pwa` to enable immediate service worker updates
- Monitor service worker updates in the **Application** tab of DevTools

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Deploying a Next.js PWA isn't just about pushing to production — it's about delivering a **native-like experience** from the browser. Whether you use Vercel, Netlify, or a custom server, make sure your app meets all installability and performance criteria.

> A PWA is only as good as its deployment. Get it right, and your app works anywhere — fast, offline, and installable.
