### ü™ù Custom Hooks in React ‚Äì A Simple, Practical Breakdown

So here's the thing ‚Äî when you‚Äôre building components in React and you start noticing that the same logic is getting copy-pasted across different files (like managing form inputs, timers, or API calls), that's usually a sign you need a **custom hook**.

React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` are great, but custom hooks let you **bundle and reuse logic** cleanly ‚Äî almost like you're building your own tiny React features.

#### üöÄ What Exactly Is a Custom Hook?

A **custom hook** is just a JavaScript function that:

* starts with the word `use`
* and **can use other hooks inside it**

It‚Äôs not magic. It‚Äôs just a normal function ‚Äî but by convention and power, it becomes reusable logic you can plug into your components.

---

#### üß† Why Use Custom Hooks?

Here‚Äôs why I personally use them:

1. **Avoid repeating logic** ‚Äì especially form handlers, timers, API fetchers, etc.
2. **Clean up components** ‚Äì keeps components focused on rendering
3. **Easier to test and debug** ‚Äì isolated logic = easier mental model

---

#### üß™ Example: Custom Hook for Window Width

Say you want to track window width in multiple components ‚Äî instead of writing `useEffect + event listener` combo everywhere, you can write:

```jsx
// useWindowWidth.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return width;
}

export default useWindowWidth;
```

Then in your component:

```jsx
import useWindowWidth from './useWindowWidth';

function MyComponent() {
  const width = useWindowWidth();

  return <p>Screen width is {width}px</p>;
}
```

Boom ‚Äî no clutter in your component, and logic is reusable anywhere.

---

#### üí° Naming Tip

Always start with `use` ‚Äî like `useForm`, `useDebounce`, `useScrollPosition`. It‚Äôs not just a naming rule; React uses that to verify it‚Äôs a hook.

---

#### üîÅ Custom Hook Best Practices

* Don‚Äôt call hooks conditionally (React rule)
* Keep them **pure** ‚Äì they should do one thing well
* You can **return multiple values** ‚Äì objects are great
* Great for **abstracting business logic**, not just UI

---

#### üõ† Real-World Hooks I‚Äôve Written

* `useDebounce` ‚Äì delays value updates while typing
* `usePrevious` ‚Äì tracks previous value of a prop or state
* `useToggle` ‚Äì boolean toggle logic (`true/false`)
* `useFetch` ‚Äì simplified fetch with loading/error state

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Summary (in a very casual way)

Custom hooks are like reusable Lego pieces for logic. Instead of rebuilding the same stuff over and over in each component, you just pack it into a hook once, then plug it in wherever you need it. They make your code **cleaner, drier, and more maintainable** ‚Äî and once you start writing them, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them.

---

## Examples: 

## üïí `useDebounce` ‚Äì When You Don‚Äôt Want to Fire Logic Too Quickly

You know when users are typing into a search box, and you don‚Äôt want to call the API on *every* keystroke? That‚Äôs where **debouncing** comes in. You wait for them to stop typing for a moment (say 500ms) before actually doing something.

Here's a **custom hook** to help with that:

```jsx
// useDebounce.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useDebounce(value, delay = 500) {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    return () => clearTimeout(timeout); // Reset the timer if value changes
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
}

export default useDebounce;
```

### üß™ How to use it:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import useDebounce from './useDebounce';

function SearchBar() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const debouncedInput = useDebounce(input, 600);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedInput) {
      console.log('Fetching results for:', debouncedInput);
      // Call your search API here
    }
  }, [debouncedInput]);

  return (
    <input
      placeholder="Search..."
      value={input}
      onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è `useForm` ‚Äì Reusable Hook for Managing Input State

Typing the same `onChange` and `value` logic for every field is a pain. This hook helps manage multiple form fields easily with just one handler.

### üß© The Hook:

```jsx
// useForm.js
import { useState } from 'react';

function useForm(initialValues = {}) {
  const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setValues(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }));
  };

  const resetForm = () => setValues(initialValues);

  return { values, handleChange, resetForm };
}

export default useForm;
```

### üîç Usage Example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import useForm from './useForm';

function ContactForm() {
  const { values, handleChange, resetForm } = useForm({
    name: '',
    email: '',
    message: '',
  });

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Submitting form:', values);
    resetForm();
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input name="name" value={values.name} onChange={handleChange} placeholder="Name" />
      <input name="email" value={values.email} onChange={handleChange} placeholder="Email" />
      <textarea name="message" value={values.message} onChange={handleChange} placeholder="Message" />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

---

### üß† Summary (in human terms):

* `useDebounce` = wait until user stops typing, then act
* `useForm` = clean way to manage multiple inputs with a single handler

Both hooks are **massive time-savers** once you start building bigger forms or interactive UIs. 

---


## üß© `useThrottle` ‚Äì Custom React Hook

> "Use this when you want to limit how often something runs, even if it‚Äôs triggered constantly ‚Äî like scroll events, resize, or rapid typing."

### üõ†Ô∏è Hook Code: `useThrottle.js`

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

/**
 * Custom throttle hook
 * @param {any} value - The value you want to throttle (usually input or scroll position)
 * @param {number} delay - Time in ms to throttle
 * @returns throttled version of the input value
 */
function useThrottle(value, delay = 500) {
  const [throttledValue, setThrottledValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setThrottledValue(value);
    }, delay);

    return () => clearTimeout(handler); // Cancel timeout if value changes within delay
  }, [value, delay]);

  return throttledValue;
}

export default useThrottle;
```

---

### üîç Example Usage:

Let‚Äôs say you want to log scroll position, but **only once every 500ms**, no matter how fast the user scrolls.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import useThrottle from './useThrottle';

function ThrottledScrollLogger() {
  const [scrollY, setScrollY] = useState(0);
  const throttledScrollY = useThrottle(scrollY, 500);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleScroll = () => {
      setScrollY(window.scrollY);
    };

    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('üìç Throttled scrollY:', throttledScrollY);
  }, [throttledScrollY]);

  return <div style={{ height: '2000px' }}>Scroll down and watch the logs</div>;
}
```

### ‚úÖ When to Use `useThrottle` vs `useDebounce`

| Use Case                             | Throttle | Debounce                |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| Scroll / resize                      | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå                       |
| Search input (API after user pauses) | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ                       |
| Button spam protection               | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ (depends on behavior) |
| Autocomplete while typing            | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ                       |

---

### üí° Dev Notes

* It's stateless from the component‚Äôs point of view ‚Äî it doesn't block the event, just **throttles how often the value is updated**.
* Easy to plug into things like `window.scroll`, `mousemove`, or even **controlled inputs** if needed.

## üß† **Conceptual Difference**

| Feature           | **Debounce**                                  | **Throttle**                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **When it fires** | **After user stops triggering** the event     | **At regular intervals** while event is firing     |
| **Use case**      | Typing in search box (wait before firing API) | Scroll, resize, mousemove (limit update frequency) |
| **Behavior**      | "Wait until quiet, then run"                  | "Run every X ms, ignore in between"                |

---

### üïµÔ∏è Let‚Äôs use a real-world example:

Imagine a **"search as you type"** input field:

* **Debounce**:
  The API call only fires **after** the user **stops typing** for 500ms.
  ‚Üí Saves API calls. You don't care about mid-typing.

* **Throttle**:
  The API call fires **every 500ms**, no matter how fast the user types.
  ‚Üí Keeps updating at regular intervals, even during typing.

---

## üîß Code Logic Differences

### ‚úÖ **Debounce Logic**

* **Clear timeout** every time the event fires
* **Restart countdown**
* Only **runs once**, after no events for `delay` ms

```js
// Debounce
if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout);
timeout = setTimeout(() => runFn(), delay);
```

### ‚úÖ **Throttle Logic**

* Check **if enough time has passed** since last call
* If yes ‚Üí run function
* If not ‚Üí ignore the event

```js
// Throttle (logic variant)
if (Date.now() - lastRun >= delay) {
  runFn();
  lastRun = Date.now();
}
```

> In our React hook version, we simulate throttle by **delaying the update**, but we don't reset the timer like debounce does.

---

## üìù In Simple Words:

> üßò **Debounce waits until the user stops.**
> üèÉ **Throttle lets things through at a steady pace.**


----

> Q: so major differnce is debounce is one time while throttle is interval 


Exactly. ‚úÖ That‚Äôs the core difference ‚Äî you‚Äôve nailed it.

Here‚Äôs a **simple breakdown** that captures the essence in plain words:

## üß† Debounce vs Throttle: Real-World Analogy

| Concept         | Explanation                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üßò **Debounce** | "Wait until things stop happening, then act **once**."                  |
| üèÉ **Throttle** | "Act **every X milliseconds**, no matter how many times things happen." |

---

## üîÑ Summary of the Core Difference:

| Feature             | **Debounce**                             | **Throttle**                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Timing behavior** | Waits for silence, then fires **once**   | Fires repeatedly at fixed intervals                              |
| **Usage goal**      | React only after user stops              | Limit how often a function runs                                  |
| **Example**         | Search box (wait till user stops typing) | Scroll event (update every 500ms max)                            |
| **Frequency**       | Executes only **once** after delay       | Executes **multiple times**, but not more than once per interval |

### ‚úÖ TL;DR:

> Debounce = *‚ÄúJust one, after a pause.‚Äù*
> Throttle = *‚ÄúSteady bursts, no flooding.‚Äù*

---

My take on this:

> Debouncing with 500 ms delay: A user makes API request first time. The API will be triggered after 500ms. So an API request instance is created. That instance will trigger after 500 ms. If a user makes another API request and it sees the previous instance already exists. Then it kills the old instance and again 500 ms he has to wait.

> Throttling with 500 ms delay: A user makes API request first time. The current timestamp is noted. The API will trigger at current timestamp + 500 ms. Any requests below this time will be rejected. once 500 ms is complete, any new request will be accepted. 


Major difference : 

debounce appends time to original time if user requests multiple requests within the delayed time and the last request is executed after 500 ms. 
__Debounce says__: if you made a request, wait for 500 ms for another request else i will reject the previous request instances and replace with the new request instance.  

While in throttling, execution is in 500 ms intervals. i.e. 1 request / 500 ms. Even the user floods with 1000 requests in the 500 ms time range. 

__throttling says__: if you made a request, wait for 500 ms for another request else i will reject any number of request instances you make.
