# 🔹 Amazon Route 53

Amazon Route 53 is **AWS’s managed DNS service**. It is designed to provide **high availability, scalability, and reliability** for domain name resolution.

### Key Features:

1. **Authoritative DNS**

   * Route 53 is an *authoritative DNS*, meaning customers can create and update DNS records.
   * Unlike a caching resolver, Route 53 always gives the final authoritative answer for your domain.

2. **Domain Registrar**

   * Route 53 can act as a **domain registrar** (like GoDaddy), where you can directly purchase and register domains.

3. **Health Checks**

   * Route 53 can monitor the health of endpoints (like EC2 instances or load balancers).
   * Based on health, it can route traffic away from unhealthy resources.

4. **Availability SLA**

   * Route 53 is the **only AWS service with a 100% availability SLA**, ensuring your DNS queries are always resolved.

5. **Why the name “53”?**

   * ==The number **53** refers to **port 53**, the default port used by DNS.==

> __Note__: 
> In AWS, a __Service Level Agreement (SLA)__ is a formal, binding commitment from Amazon Web Services defining the level of performance and availability for a specific AWS service. It acts as a contract that details performance metrics like uptime, specifies how performance is measured, and outlines service credits or other remedies for the customer if AWS fails to meet the promised service levels.

# 🔹 Route 53 – Records

In Route 53, you define **DNS records** to tell how traffic should be routed for your domain.

### Each DNS record contains:

* **Domain/Subdomain Name** → e.g., `example.com`, `api.example.com`.
* **Record Type** → e.g., `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `NS`.
* **Value** → The IP address or target domain (e.g., `54.22.33.44`).
* **Routing Policy** → How Route 53 responds to queries (e.g., failover, latency-based, weighted routing).
* **TTL (Time To Live)** → How long the record is cached by DNS resolvers.

### Supported Record Types:

1. **Basic (must know):**

   * `A` (IPv4 mapping)
   * `AAAA` (IPv6 mapping)
   * `CNAME` (alias to another domain)
   * `NS` (delegates DNS to name servers)

2. **Advanced (used in specific scenarios):**

   * `MX` (Mail Exchange – email routing)
   * `SOA` (Start of Authority – zone info)
   * `TXT` (arbitrary text, often used for verification like SPF/DKIM)
   * `CAA` (Certificate Authority Authorization – controls who can issue SSL certs)
   * `PTR` (reverse DNS lookup)
   * `SPF` (mail sender policy – now usually inside TXT)
   * `SRV`, `NAPTR`, `DS`, etc. (specialized records).

# 🔹 Route 53 – Record Types Explained

1. **A Record**

   * Maps a hostname → **IPv4 address**.
   * Example: `example.com → 192.0.2.1`.

2. **AAAA Record**

   * Maps a hostname → **IPv6 address**.
   * Example: `example.com → 2001:db8::1`.

3. **CNAME (Canonical Name) Record**

   * Maps one domain to another domain name.
   * Example: `www.example.com → example.com`.
   * Restrictions:

     * Target must be another domain (not an IP).
     * Cannot use CNAME at the **zone apex** (e.g., you can’t assign a CNAME to `example.com`, but you can assign it to `www.example.com`).

4. **NS Record (Name Server Record)**

   * Specifies the authoritative name servers for a domain.
   * Example: `example.com → ns-123.awsdns-45.com`.
   * These define which DNS servers will answer queries for your domain.

# 🔹 Why Route 53 is Powerful

* Combines **DNS + Health Checks + Domain Registration** in one service.
* Provides **routing policies** beyond standard DNS:

  * **Simple Routing** (basic record resolution).
  * **Weighted Routing** (split traffic by percentage).
  * **Latency-based Routing** (direct to lowest latency region).
  * **Failover Routing** (redirect to backup if primary fails).
  * **Geo-location Routing** (based on user’s location).

✅ In short: **Amazon Route 53** is more than just a DNS service. It’s a **global traffic management system**, offering domain registration, health checks, advanced routing policies, and the reliability of AWS.
