### 🔹 Topic: **Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive)**

---

## 🔹 1. **What is Binary Search?**

**Binary Search** is an efficient searching algorithm that works on **sorted arrays/lists**.
It follows the **Divide and Conquer** principle to **reduce the search space by half** at each step.

> 🔍 Used to find the position of a target element in **O(log n)** time.

---

## 🔹 2. **Precondition: Sorted Data**

Binary Search only works when:

* The data structure (array/list) is **sorted in increasing or decreasing order**
* Random or unsorted data must be sorted first (O(n log n) time) before applying Binary Search

---

## 🔹 3. **How Binary Search Works**

Given a **sorted array `arr[0…n-1]`** and a target `key`:

1. Find the middle index `mid = (low + high) // 2`
2. If `arr[mid] == key`, return `mid`
3. If `key < arr[mid]`, search in **left half**
4. If `key > arr[mid]`, search in **right half**
5. Repeat until `low > high`

---

## 🔹 4. **Iterative Binary Search**

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, key):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == key:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < key:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1  # key not found
```

---

## 🔹 5. **Recursive Binary Search**

```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, key, low, high):
    if low > high:
        return -1

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    if arr[mid] == key:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] > key:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, key, low, mid - 1)
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, key, mid + 1, high)
```

## 🔹 6. **Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation       | Iterative Form | Recursive Form                |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Best Case       | O(1)           | O(1)                          |
| Worst Case      | O(log n)       | O(log n)                      |
| Average Case    | O(log n)       | O(log n)                      |
| Auxiliary Space | O(1)           | O(log n) (due to stack calls) |

---

## 🔹 7. **Dry Run Example**

Given:

```python
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
key = 10
```

**Step-wise Iteration:**

* low = 0, high = 6 → mid = 3 → arr\[3] = 8 → 10 > 8 → low = 4
* mid = 5 → arr\[5] = 12 → 10 < 12 → high = 4
* mid = 4 → arr\[4] = 10 → ✅ found

## 🔹 8. **GATE-Level Pitfalls and Traps**

| Mistake                                           | Explanation                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Trying binary search on unsorted data             | ❌ Binary search won't work unless data is sorted |
| Off-by-one errors (`low < high` vs `low <= high`) | May skip valid mid                               |
| Mid formula overflow (in C/C++)                   | Prefer `mid = low + (high - low) // 2`           |
| Infinite loop due to wrong bounds                 | Always update low/high correctly                 |

## 🔹 9. **Key Properties of Binary Search**

* Requires **sorted input**
* Reduces search space by **half** each time
* Time complexity: **O(log n)**
* Space complexity:

  * **Iterative**: O(1)
  * **Recursive**: O(log n) (call stack)

## 🔹 10. **When Not to Use Binary Search**

| Case                                    | Reason                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| On unsorted data                        | Cannot find correct index         |
| On linked lists                         | No random access                  |
| Very small datasets                     | Linear search may be faster       |
| Costly comparator (non-primitive types) | log n comparisons still expensive |

## ✅ Final Tips for GATE DA

* Stick to the **iterative pattern** for most code-based MCQs.
* Practice dry-run questions: key = 0, key = last, key not present.
* Understand **bound updates** and conditions carefully (`low <= high` vs `low < high`).
* Practice tracing with **odd/even-length arrays**.
