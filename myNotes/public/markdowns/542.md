## Search in Artificial Intelligence

### ðŸ”¹ What is Search in AI?

Search is a fundamental problem-solving technique in AI where an **agent** navigates through a **state space** to find a path from an **initial state** to a **goal state**.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Components of a Search Problem:

| Component        | Description                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial State    | The starting point of the problem.                   |
| Goal Test        | A function to determine whether a state is the goal. |
| Actions          | A function returning possible actions from a state.  |
| Transition Model | Returns the result of applying an action to a state. |
| Path Cost        | A function that assigns a numeric cost to each path. |

## ðŸ”¸ Types of Search

### 1. **Uninformed (Blind) Search**

Does not use any domain-specific knowledge.

| Algorithm                  | Strategy       | Completeness | Optimality | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Breadth-First Search (BFS) | FIFO Queue     | Yes          | Yes        | O(b^d)          | O(b^d)           |
| Depth-First Search (DFS)   | Stack (LIFO)   | No           | No         | O(b^m)          | O(b\*m)          |
| Uniform Cost Search (UCS)  | Min Path Cost  | Yes          | Yes        | O(b^(1+C\*/Îµ))  | O(b^(1+C\*/Îµ))   |
| Depth-Limited Search       | DFS with depth | No           | No         | O(b^l)          | O(b\*l)          |
| Iterative Deepening DFS    | DFS + BFS      | Yes          | Yes        | O(b^d)          | O(b\*d)          |

* **b**: branching factor
* **d**: depth of the shallowest goal
* **m**: maximum depth of the search tree
* **C\***: cost of the optimal solution
* **Îµ**: minimum step cost

### 2. **Informed (Heuristic) Search**

Uses problem-specific knowledge (heuristics) to find solutions more efficiently.

#### Heuristic Function:

* $h(n)$: Estimated cost from node $n$ to the goal.
* **Admissible**: Never overestimates the cost.
* **Consistent (Monotonic)**: $h(n) \leq c(n, a, n') + h(n')$

| Algorithm                | Strategy                    | Completeness             | Optimality | Time Complexity       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Greedy Best-First Search | Minimize h(n)               | No                       | No         | O(b^m)                |
| A\* Search               | Minimize f(n) = g(n) + h(n) | Yes (if h is admissible) | Yes        | O(b^d) (depends on h) |

### 3. **Adversarial Search (Game Playing)**

Used for games like chess, tic-tac-toe where agents compete.

| Term                | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Minimax             | Recursive strategy assuming perfect play by both players.                |
| Alpha-Beta Pruning  | Optimization that cuts off branches that donâ€™t influence final decision. |
| Evaluation Function | Heuristic to estimate utility at non-terminal states.                    |

### âœ… Summary

* **Uninformed search**: No heuristics, explores blindly.
* **Informed search**: Uses heuristics to guide search.
* **Adversarial search**: Competitive settings with opponents, using minimax and pruning.
