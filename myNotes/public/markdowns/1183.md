# **Chapter 3 – Processes (Sections 3.1–3.4)**

---

## **3.1 Process Concept**

### **What is a Process?**
- A **process** is an *active* program in execution.
- Includes:
  - **Program code** (text section)
  - **Program counter (PC)** (next instruction address)
  - **Stack** (function calls, local variables)
  - **Data section** (global/static variables)
  - **Heap** (dynamically allocated memory)
- Process ≠ Program:  
  - **Program** → Passive, stored on disk.  
  - **Process** → Active, executing in memory.

---

### **Process States** *(five classic states)*

1. **New** – Process is being created.
2. **Ready** – Waiting in main memory to be assigned CPU.
3. **Running** – Instructions are executing on CPU.
4. **Waiting/Blocked** – Waiting for some event (I/O, signal).
5. **Terminated** – Finished execution.

**State Diagram:**
```
 New → Ready → Running → Terminated
           ↑      ↓
        Waiting ←
```

### **Process Control Block (PCB)**
The **PCB** stores **all information needed to manage a process**.

- **Process State**
- **Program Counter**
- **CPU Registers** (general-purpose, stack pointers, etc.)
- **CPU Scheduling Info** (priority, queue pointers)
- **Memory Management Info** (base, limit registers, page tables)
- **Accounting Info** (CPU used, time limits, process ID)
- **I/O Status Info** (open file list, devices in use)

**Role:** When a process is switched out, PCB is saved; when switched in, PCB is restored.

---

## **3.2 Process Scheduling**

OS must schedule processes for **maximum CPU utilization** & **minimum waiting time**.

### **Scheduling Queues**
- **Job Queue:** All processes in the system.
- **Ready Queue:** Processes in memory, ready to execute.
- **Device Queue:** Processes waiting for a specific I/O device.

---

### **Schedulers**
1. **Long-Term Scheduler** (Job Scheduler)
   - Controls degree of multiprogramming.
   - Decides which jobs enter ready queue.
2. **Short-Term Scheduler** (CPU Scheduler)
   - Picks next process from ready queue for execution.
3. **Medium-Term Scheduler**
   - Temporarily removes (suspends) processes to reduce load → later resumes them.

---

### **Context Switch**
- Process switch requires saving PCB of current process and loading PCB of next process.
- Context switch time = **pure overhead** (no useful work done).

---

## **3.3 Operations on Processes**

Processes are **created** and **terminated**.

### **Process Creation**
- In UNIX: `fork()` system call creates new process.
- **Parent Process** creates **Child Process** (may form a tree).
- Child may:
  1. Continue executing parent’s code.
  2. Load new program with `exec()`.

**Resource Sharing Models:**
- Parent & child share all resources.
- Child shares subset.
- No sharing.

---

### **Process Termination**
- **Normal exit** (status 0)
- **Error exit**
- **Killed** by another process (`kill` in UNIX).
- When parent terminates → children often terminated too (**cascading termination**).

**Zombie Process:** Process finished but parent hasn’t collected exit status via `wait()` → remains in process table.  
**Orphan Process:** Parent terminates while child still running → child is adopted by `init` process.

---

## **3.4 Interprocess Communication (IPC)**

Processes may be:
- **Independent** – Do not share data/state.
- **Cooperating** – Share data/state; need synchronization.

### **Reasons for IPC:**
- Information sharing
- Computation speed-up
- Modularity
- Convenience

---

### **Models of IPC**

#### **1. Message Passing**
- **send(msg)** and **receive(msg)** primitives.
- No shared memory.
- Suitable for distributed systems.
- Can be blocking (synchronous) or non-blocking (asynchronous).

**Direct Communication:**
- Processes name each other explicitly.
- Link is established automatically.

**Indirect Communication:**
- Messages sent via mailboxes (ports).
- Multiple senders/receivers.

---

#### **2. Shared Memory**
- Processes share a region of memory.
- Faster than message passing (no kernel involvement after setup).
- Requires synchronization (semaphores, mutex).

---

## **GATE Exam Pointers**
- PCB contents & its role are very common MCQs.
- Difference between **process** and **program** is often tested.
- Context switch → pure overhead.
- **Zombie vs Orphan** definitions frequently appear in 1-mark questions.
- IPC models (shared memory vs message passing) → short-answer favorite.
