### ðŸ“˜ Redis Sorted Sets â€“ Basic Commands (`ZADD`, `ZRANGE`, etc.) â€“ Detailed Note

**Redis Sorted Sets (ZSETs)** are collections of **unique string members** where each member is associated with a **floating-point score**. The elements are **automatically ordered** by their score. Sorted Sets are ideal for use cases like **leaderboards**, **ranking systems**, and **time-based events**.

Redis provides a rich set of commands to **add**, **update**, **query**, and **remove** elements from a Sorted Set.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. `ZADD` â€“ Add Members with Scores

### âœ… Purpose:

Adds one or more members with their respective scores to a Sorted Set. If a member already exists, its score is updated.

### ðŸ”§ Syntax:

```bash
ZADD key score1 member1 [score2 member2 ...]
```

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```bash
ZADD leaderboard 100 "Alice" 150 "Bob" 120 "Charlie"
```

### ðŸŸ¢ Notes:

* Returns the number of **new elements added** (excluding updates).
* Use options like `NX`, `XX`, `CH`, and `INCR` for control:

  * `NX`: Only add if member doesn't exist
  * `XX`: Only update if member exists
  * `CH`: Return count of elements added or updated
  * `INCR`: Increment the score of a member

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. `ZRANGE` â€“ Get Members by Rank (Low to High)

### âœ… Purpose:

Returns members in ascending order of score, by rank (index).

### ðŸ”§ Syntax:

```bash
ZRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES]
```

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```bash
ZRANGE leaderboard 0 2 WITHSCORES
# â†’ ["Alice", "100", "Charlie", "120", "Bob", "150"]
```

* `start = 0`, `stop = -1` returns all members.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. `ZREVRANGE` â€“ Get Members by Rank (High to Low)

### âœ… Purpose:

Returns members in **descending** order of score.

### ðŸ”§ Syntax:

```bash
ZREVRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES]
```

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```bash
ZREVRANGE leaderboard 0 1
# â†’ ["Bob", "Charlie"]
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. `ZRANK` â€“ Get Rank of Member (Asc Order)

```bash
ZRANK key member
```

* Returns the **zero-based rank** of a member in ascending order.

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```bash
ZRANK leaderboard "Charlie"
# â†’ 1
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. `ZREVRANK` â€“ Get Rank of Member (Desc Order)

```bash
ZREVRANK key member
```

* Returns rank in **descending** order.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. `ZSCORE` â€“ Get Score of Member

```bash
ZSCORE key member
```

* Returns the score associated with the given member.

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```bash
ZSCORE leaderboard "Bob"
# â†’ "150"
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. `ZINCRBY` â€“ Increment Score

```bash
ZINCRBY key increment member
```

* Adds `increment` to the memberâ€™s score.

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```bash
ZINCRBY leaderboard 20 "Alice"
# Aliceâ€™s score becomes 120
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. `ZREM` â€“ Remove Member(s)

```bash
ZREM key member [member ...]
```

* Removes one or more members from the Sorted Set.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. `ZCARD` â€“ Count Members

```bash
ZCARD key
```

* Returns the total number of elements in the Sorted Set.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 10. `ZCOUNT` â€“ Count by Score Range

```bash
ZCOUNT key min max
```

* Returns the number of elements with scores between `min` and `max`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 11. `ZRANGEBYSCORE` â€“ Range by Score (Asc)

```bash
ZRANGEBYSCORE key min max [WITHSCORES] [LIMIT offset count]
```

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```bash
ZRANGEBYSCORE leaderboard 100 130
# â†’ ["Alice", "Charlie"]
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 12. `ZREMRANGEBYRANK` / `ZREMRANGEBYSCORE`

* Remove elements by rank or score range.

```bash
ZREMRANGEBYRANK key start stop
ZREMRANGEBYSCORE key min max
```

### âœ… Final Thoughts

Redis Sorted Sets are incredibly powerful when it comes to managing **ranked data**, **priority queues**, and **time series-like data**. With atomic operations and fast access by score or rank, they are a go-to structure for real-time ranking, scoring, and sorting tasks.
