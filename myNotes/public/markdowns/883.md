### **Sequential Circuits – Overview**

Unlike combinational circuits, **sequential circuits** have **memory elements** that store past input states. This allows the **output to depend on both the present input and the past (stored) state**. Sequential circuits are fundamental in building counters, registers, memory units, and clocked systems like CPUs.

### **Key Characteristics**

* Depend on **present inputs** and **past states**.
* Use **flip-flops** or **latches** as memory elements.
* Include a **clock signal** to synchronize changes.
* Categorized into **synchronous** (clock-driven) and **asynchronous** (input-driven) circuits.

### **Flip-Flops (FF)**

A **flip-flop** is a basic memory element in sequential logic. It holds **1-bit** of data and changes state based on input and clock edges. Flip-flops are **edge-triggered**, meaning they respond only to rising or falling clock edges.

### **1. S-R (Set-Reset) Flip-Flop**

* **Inputs**: S (Set), R (Reset), and Enable (E)
* **Operation**:

  * When **E = 1**, behaves like a basic S-R latch:

    * **S = 1, R = 0** → Output Q = 1 (Set)
    * **S = 0, R = 1** → Output Q = 0 (Reset)
    * **S = R = 0** → No change
    * **S = R = 1** → Invalid state (should be avoided)
  * When **E = 0**, output holds previous state (disabled)
* **Use**: Basic memory storage with control over enable.

### **2. Master-Slave JK Flip-Flop**

* **Built with**: Two S-R flip-flops in cascade (Master and Slave)
* **Inputs**: J, K, Clock (CLK)
* **Operation**:

  * On **positive CLK edge**, **Master** captures input.
  * On **negative CLK edge**, **Slave** updates output based on Master’s state.
* **Handles J = K = 1** safely, toggling the output.
* **Advantage**: Removes race-around condition present in basic JK FF.
* **Use**: Reliable state toggling in synchronous systems.

---

### **3. D (Data or Delay) Flip-Flop**

* **Inputs**: D (Data), Clock (CLK)
* **Output**: Q = D (after a delay at clock edge)
* Internally: D input is connected through an **inverter to SR inputs**.
* Prevents invalid states (like S=R=1 or S=R=0).
* On each clock edge, Q simply **copies the D input**.
* **Use**: Data storage, registers, memory cells.

### **Why It’s Called “Delay” Flip-Flop**

The term "delay" comes from the fact that the input **D** is reflected at the output **Q** after the **clock edge**, effectively introducing a **delay of one clock cycle**.

### **Applications of Sequential Circuits**

* **Registers**: Temporary data storage.
* **Counters**: Track number of clock cycles/events.
* **Shift Registers**: Bit-level data manipulation.
* **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Used in control systems, protocol design.
* **Memory units**: RAM cells use flip-flop structures.
