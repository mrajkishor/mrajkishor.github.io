# Basic Authentication and Authorization with Spring Security

Securing applications is a fundamental requirement in modern software development. Basic Authentication and Authorization are the foundational concepts that ensure only authenticated and authorized users can access specific resources in an application. In this blog, we will explore these concepts in detail and demonstrate how to implement them using Spring Security.

## What Is Basic Authentication?

**Basic Authentication** is a method for a web browser or client to provide a username and password when making a request to a server. The credentials are sent as a Base64-encoded string in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request. While simple to implement, Basic Authentication is often combined with HTTPS to ensure credentials are encrypted during transmission.

### How It Works:
1. The client sends an HTTP request with the `Authorization` header containing the Base64-encoded username and password.
2. The server decodes the header, validates the credentials, and grants or denies access based on the result.

## What Is Authorization?

**Authorization** determines what resources a user can access based on their roles or permissions. While authentication verifies who the user is, authorization ensures they can perform specific actions.

### Key Concepts in Authorization:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Permissions are granted based on predefined roles.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Permissions are granted based on specific attributes or conditions.

## Setting Up Basic Authentication and Authorization in Spring Security

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Example Implementation

#### Step 1: Configure Basic Authentication
Create a security configuration class to set up Basic Authentication.

```java
package com.example.security;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.authentication.builders.AuthenticationManagerBuilder;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth
            .inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("user")
            .password("{noop}password") // {noop} indicates no password encoding
            .roles("USER")
            .and()
            .withUser("admin")
            .password("{noop}admin")
            .roles("ADMIN");
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf().disable()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .httpBasic();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Authentication Configuration:**
   - We use `inMemoryAuthentication` to define users (`user` and `admin`) with their respective roles.
   - `{noop}` disables password encoding for simplicity in this example (not recommended for production).

2. **Authorization Rules:**
   - `/admin/**`: Restricted to users with the `ADMIN` role.
   - `/user/**`: Restricted to users with the `USER` role.
   - Other endpoints require authentication but are not role-restricted.

3. **HTTP Basic:**
   - Configures Basic Authentication by enabling `.httpBasic()`.

---

#### Step 2: Create Controller Endpoints
Define endpoints to test authentication and authorization.

```java
package com.example.security.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class DemoController {

    @GetMapping("/admin")
    public String adminAccess() {
        return "Hello Admin!";
    }

    @GetMapping("/user")
    public String userAccess() {
        return "Hello User!";
    }

    @GetMapping("/public")
    public String publicAccess() {
        return "Hello Public!";
    }
}
```

---

### Testing the Implementation

#### Using Postman or Curl:
1. **Access Public Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/public
   ```
   Response:
   ```
   Hello Public!
   ```

2. **Access User Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/user -u user:password
   ```
   Response:
   ```
   Hello User!
   ```

3. **Access Admin Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/admin -u admin:admin
   ```
   Response:
   ```
   Hello Admin!
   ```

#### Incorrect Credentials:
When accessing secured endpoints with invalid credentials, youâ€™ll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

### Enhancing Security

1. **Password Encoding:**
   Replace `{noop}` with a password encoder like BCrypt:
   ```java
   .password(passwordEncoder().encode("password"))
   ```

2. **HTTPS:**
   Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt credentials during transmission.

3. **External User Store:**
   Use a database or LDAP for managing user credentials in production systems.

## Conclusion

Basic Authentication and Authorization form the foundation of application security. With Spring Security, implementing these features is straightforward and highly configurable. While this example provides a starting point, always aim to follow best practices like password encryption and HTTPS to ensure your application is secure.

In the next blog, we will explore advanced topics like JWT and OAuth2 to build stateless and scalable authentication systems.
