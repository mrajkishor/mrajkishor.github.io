# 🚦 Solving Weighted Shortest Path Problems – Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, A\*

Shortest path problems are classic in DSA and come in many forms. When the graph has **weights on its edges**, choosing the right algorithm is critical to ensure correctness and performance.

---

## 🧩 Problem Type: Weighted Graph

* **Input**: Graph with nodes and weighted edges.
* **Goal**: Find the **shortest (minimum total weight)** path from a source to all other nodes or a destination.
* **Graph**: Can be **directed** or **undirected**, may include **positive** or **negative** weights.

---

## ✅ Algorithm Choices

### 1. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

> **Best when**: All weights are **non-negative**.

* **Time Complexity**:

  * `O((V + E) log V)` with a min-heap (priority queue)
* **Data Structures**:

  * Priority Queue (Min Heap)
  * Adjacency List
  * Distance Array

### **Key Idea**:

Use a greedy strategy. Always expand the node with the smallest tentative distance.

### **Pseudocode**:

```java
PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(); // (distance, node)
int[] dist = new int[n];
Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
dist[src] = 0;
pq.offer(new Pair(0, src));

while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
    Pair current = pq.poll();
    for (Edge edge : graph[current.node]) {
        int newDist = dist[current.node] + edge.weight;
        if (newDist < dist[edge.neighbor]) {
            dist[edge.neighbor] = newDist;
            pq.offer(new Pair(newDist, edge.neighbor));
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

> **Best when**: There are **negative weights** and you need to **detect negative cycles**.

* **Time Complexity**: `O(V * E)`
* **Handles**: Negative weights
* **Drawback**: Slower than Dijkstra for large graphs

### **Key Idea**:

Relax all edges `V - 1` times. If you can still relax after that, a negative cycle exists.

### **Pseudocode**:

```java
int[] dist = new int[n];
Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
dist[src] = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (Edge e : edges) {
        if (dist[e.from] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dist[e.from] + e.weight < dist[e.to]) {
            dist[e.to] = dist[e.from] + e.weight;
        }
    }
}

// Detect negative cycle
for (Edge e : edges) {
    if (dist[e.from] + e.weight < dist[e.to]) {
        // Negative cycle detected
    }
}
```

### 3. **A\* (A Star) Algorithm**

> **Best when**: You need shortest path from source to a **target node**, with a **heuristic** guiding the search (e.g., in pathfinding).

* **Time Complexity**: Similar to Dijkstra, depends on heuristic accuracy
* **Requires**: A **heuristic function `h(n)`** that estimates cost to reach target
* **Commonly Used In**: Grid-based pathfinding, maps, games

### **Key Idea**:

Use a priority queue where the priority is `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`,

* `g(n)` is the distance from start to node `n`,
* `h(n)` is estimated distance from `n` to goal.

## 🔍 Summary Comparison

| Algorithm    | Handles Negative Weights | Detects Negative Cycle | Best Use Case                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Dijkstra     | ❌ No                     | ❌ No                   | Fastest for non-negative weights      |
| Bellman-Ford | ✅ Yes                    | ✅ Yes                  | When negative weights or cycles exist |
| A\*          | ❌ (Usually not)          | ❌ No                   | Grid/AI pathfinding with target node  |

## ✅ Final Tip

> For **interviews**, mastering **Dijkstra** and **Bellman-Ford** is essential.
> A\* is great for **grid-based or game dev roles**.

Always analyze:

* Is it a **single source** or **single destination** problem?
* Are there **negative weights**?
* Is the graph **sparse or dense**?

Knowing this will guide you to the right algorithm.
