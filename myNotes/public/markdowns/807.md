### ðŸ¤” Why Do Imports Matter for Bundling?

Webpack builds a **dependency graph** â€” it looks at how files are connected, then bundles them accordingly.
The way you import modules â€” either statically or dynamically â€” **directly affects how and when code is loaded**.

This is especially important if you're trying to improve performance, speed up initial load times, or split bundles.

### ðŸ“¦ Static Imports

Static imports are the usual way of bringing code into your file.
Theyâ€™re **declared at the top** and are loaded **at build time**.

```js
import { formatDate } from './utils';
```

* Webpack sees this at build time.
* It includes `utils.js` in the main bundle automatically.
* It gets loaded as soon as the page loads â€” whether you use it immediately or not.

#### âœ… Good For:

* Code thatâ€™s always needed (e.g., layout, routing, global styles)
* Core logic used across the app

---

### âš¡ Dynamic Imports

Dynamic imports use `import()` syntax â€” theyâ€™re **executed at runtime**.

```js
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  import('./analytics').then((module) => {
    module.trackClick();
  });
});
```

* Webpack **creates a separate chunk** for `analytics.js`
* Itâ€™s **not included in the main bundle**
* That chunk is only loaded **when the button is clicked**

#### âœ… Good For:

* Lazy loading routes
* Features that are optional or rarely used
* Splitting large codebases into manageable pieces

---

### ðŸ§  Real World Analogy

Imagine youâ€™re packing for a trip.

* **Static import** is like packing everything on Day 1 â€” even winter clothes for a beach trip.
* **Dynamic import** is like sending a suitcase later only if it starts snowing.

---

### ðŸ’¥ Why This Matters in Webpack

* Static imports = **eager loading** = bigger initial bundle
* Dynamic imports = **lazy loading** = smaller bundle, faster load

When you use dynamic imports, Webpack automatically splits your code into chunks.
Thatâ€™s where **code splitting** kicks in, reducing first-load time and improving performance â€” especially for SPAs or large apps.
