## Asymptotic Notations (Big-O, Omega, Theta)

---

## 🔍 What Are Asymptotic Notations?

Asymptotic notations describe the **behavior of algorithms as input size grows toward infinity**. They help compare algorithms **independent of hardware**, focusing on growth trends, not actual execution time.

They’re used to:

* Estimate performance
* Compare algorithms
* Determine efficiency

## 🔺 1. **Big-O Notation `O(f(n))` — Upper Bound (Worst Case)**

### ✅ Meaning:

* Describes the **maximum time** an algorithm will take for any input of size `n`.
* It is used to **guarantee performance**.

### 📌 Formal Definition:

> A function T(n) is **O(f(n))** if there exist positive constants `c` and `n₀` such that:
>
> `T(n) ≤ c × f(n)` for all `n ≥ n₀`

### 🧠 Intuition:

If an algorithm takes `T(n) = 3n² + 2n + 4` operations, it is `O(n²)` because as `n` grows large, `n²` dominates.

### 🧪 Example:

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        print(i, j)
```

* Time Complexity: O(n²)

### 🧾 Use Cases:

* Worst-case performance
* Guarantees on scalability
* Primary focus in GATE exams

## 🔻 2. **Omega Notation `Ω(f(n))` — Lower Bound (Best Case)**

### ✅ Meaning:

* Describes the **minimum time** an algorithm will take on any input of size `n`.

### 📌 Formal Definition:

> A function T(n) is **Ω(f(n))** if there exist positive constants `c` and `n₀` such that:
>
> `T(n) ≥ c × f(n)` for all `n ≥ n₀`

### 🧠 Intuition:

If an algorithm runs very fast on sorted input but slower on others, Ω gives you that **best-case speed**.

### 🧪 Example:

```python
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == key:
        return i
```

* Best Case: Key is at index 0 → Ω(1)

---

## 🔃 3. **Theta Notation `Θ(f(n))` — Tight Bound (Average Case / Exact Growth)**

### ✅ Meaning:

* Describes the **exact time growth** — both upper and lower bounds — of an algorithm.

### 📌 Formal Definition:

> A function T(n) is **Θ(f(n))** if there exist positive constants `c₁`, `c₂`, and `n₀` such that:
>
> `c₁ × f(n) ≤ T(n) ≤ c₂ × f(n)` for all `n ≥ n₀`

### 🧠 Intuition:

If your algorithm’s time grows **neither faster nor slower than f(n)**, then it’s Θ(f(n)).

### 🧪 Example:

```python
for i in range(n):
    print(i)
```

* Best, worst, average → all Θ(n)

## 📊 Graphical Interpretation

```plaintext
| Time
|
|                  Θ(f(n))
|         ________------_________
|        /                      \
|_______/                        \_________
|      O(f(n))          Ω(f(n))
|
|------------------------------------> Input Size (n)
```

## 🔁 Comparing the Three

| Notation | Bound Type  | Focuses On   | GATE Usage     |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| O(f(n))  | Upper Bound | Worst-case   | ✅ Frequently   |
| Ω(f(n))  | Lower Bound | Best-case    | ✅ Sometimes    |
| Θ(f(n))  | Tight Bound | Exact growth | ✅ Occasionally |

## 🧪 Sample GATE Question

**Q:** What is the time complexity of the below code?

```c
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++)
    for (k = 0; k < n; k++)
      sum++;
```

**A:** T(n) = O(n³), Θ(n³), Ω(n³)

---

## 🎯 Tips for GATE Exam

* Most questions will ask for **Big-O (worst-case)**.
* Some code tracing or recursion questions may ask for **Θ**.
* **Ω** may be tested in theoretical MCQs.
* **Don’t confuse best/worst case with notation** — they describe different things:

  * Best case of Bubble Sort = O(n) (input is sorted) — but it's still **O(n²)** in general.

## 🧠 Summary

* **Big-O (O)**: Upper bound — how slow can it get.
* **Omega (Ω)**: Lower bound — how fast can it go.
* **Theta (Θ)**: Exact — how it truly behaves.

Used in algorithm analysis to:

* Describe performance
* Rank algorithms
* Decide tradeoffs
