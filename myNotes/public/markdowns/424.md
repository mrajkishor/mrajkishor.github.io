# 🛣️ `getStaticPaths` in Next.js — Pre-Rendering Dynamic Pages with Static Generation

Next.js gives developers the best of both worlds: **static site generation (SSG)** and **dynamic routing**. When building static pages with dynamic URLs (like blog posts or product pages), you’ll use `getStaticPaths` alongside `getStaticProps`.

This combo lets you **pre-render pages at build time** — even when the URLs are dynamic — making your site blazingly fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable.

---

## 🧠 What is `getStaticPaths`?

`getStaticPaths` tells Next.js **which dynamic routes to pre-render** at build time.

You use it **only with dynamic route files** like:

```bash
/pages/blog/[slug].js
/pages/product/[id].js
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When a dynamic page (e.g., `[slug].js`) uses **`getStaticProps`**, Next.js **needs to know** all the possible `slug` values **ahead of time**. That’s where `getStaticPaths` comes in.

---

## 📦 Syntax

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { slug: 'hello-world' } },
      { params: { slug: 'nextjs-tutorial' } }
    ],
    fallback: false
  };
}
```

### Combined with `getStaticProps`

```js
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const slug = params.slug;
  const post = await getPostBySlug(slug);

  return {
    props: { post }
  };
}
```

---

## 🔁 The `paths` Array

Each object inside `paths` should match the dynamic file name (e.g., `[slug]`, `[id]`, etc.).

```js
paths: [
  { params: { id: '1' } },
  { params: { id: '2' } }
]
```

---

## ⚖️ Fallback Behavior

### 🔹 `fallback: false`
- Only the paths returned will be generated.
- Any other path will return a **404**.

```js
return {
  paths: [...],
  fallback: false
};
```

### 🔹 `fallback: true`
- Next.js will generate pages **on-demand** when a user visits a path not returned initially.
- A loading state can be shown while the page is generated.

```js
return {
  paths: [...],
  fallback: true
};
```

### 🔹 `fallback: 'blocking'` (Recommended for SEO)
- Like `true`, but **waits for data** and then serves the complete page (no loading state).

```js
return {
  paths: [...],
  fallback: 'blocking'
};
```

---

## 🧪 Real Example: Blog Posts with Slugs

```js
// pages/blog/[slug].js

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await fetchPosts();

  const paths = posts.map(post => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug }
  }));

  return { paths, fallback: false };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = await fetchPostBySlug(params.slug);

  return {
    props: { post }
  };
}
```

Now, Next.js generates:
- `/blog/hello-world`
- `/blog/nextjs-is-awesome`
...at **build time**, based on available slugs.

---

## ✅ When to Use `getStaticPaths`

Use it when:
- You want **fast, pre-rendered pages** with dynamic routes.
- The content is **not changing frequently**.
- SEO and performance are a priority.
- You’re building blogs, e-commerce product pages, etc.

---

## 🚫 Don’t Use If:

- Your data **changes frequently** — prefer `getServerSideProps`.
- You have **too many dynamic pages** (e.g., millions of products) — consider `fallback: true` or `'blocking'` with incremental generation.

| Feature            | Description                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Defines dynamic paths to pre-render at build time       |
| Works with         | `getStaticProps` and dynamic routes like `[slug].js`    |
| Returns            | `{ paths: [], fallback }`                               |
| `fallback: false`  | Only generate known paths; others return 404            |
| `fallback: true`   | On-demand generation; shows loading                     |
| `fallback: 'blocking'` | On-demand generation; waits to serve full HTML     |

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

`getStaticPaths` gives you the power to combine **dynamic routing with static generation**, resulting in sites that are **lightning fast**, **SEO-optimized**, and **scalable**. It's perfect for blog posts, documentation, product pages, and more — all while keeping the benefits of Jamstack architecture.
