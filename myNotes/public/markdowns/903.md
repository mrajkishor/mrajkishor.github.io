## 🔍 React Router – Route Matching & Nesting

Once you get the basics of routing in React, the next step is understanding how **Route Matching** and **Nesting** work. These features let you build clean, structured, and scalable navigation systems — especially for real-world apps that have pages **within pages** (like settings/profile or product/details).

---

### 🧭 1. Route Matching – How React Router Chooses the Right Route

React Router uses a **top-down, first-match wins** approach. It reads through the routes inside `<Routes>` and renders the **first one** that matches the current URL.

For example:

```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  <Route path="/about/team" element={<Team />} />
</Routes>
```

When you go to `/about/team`, React Router doesn't stop at `/about`. It keeps matching **deeply**, and it will render the `/about/team` route specifically.

---

### 🎯 Exact Matching (React Router v6+)

In earlier versions (v5), you had to manually specify `exact` to avoid partial matches. In React Router v6 and above, **all routes are exact by default** — no more surprises.

```tsx
<Route path="/" element={<Home />} /> // Only renders on exact "/"
```

---

### 🧱 2. Nested Routes – Rendering Routes Inside Routes

Let’s say you have a Dashboard with sub-pages:

```
/dashboard
/dashboard/profile
/dashboard/settings
```

You want the `<Dashboard />` layout to stay visible, but change the content inside based on the nested route. That’s where **nested routing** comes in.

---

### 🔧 Setting Up Nested Routes

#### Step 1: Define Parent + Nested Routes

```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
    <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
    <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

Notice:

* Parent path is `/dashboard`
* Nested paths **do not start with `/`** – they are relative (like `"profile"`)

---

#### Step 2: Use `<Outlet />` Inside Parent

React Router needs a placeholder to show the matched child component. You do this using the special `<Outlet />` component.

```tsx
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <nav>
        <Link to="profile">Profile</Link>
        <Link to="settings">Settings</Link>
      </nav>

      <Outlet /> {/* This is where the nested route shows up */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now:

* Visiting `/dashboard` shows just the `Dashboard` component
* Visiting `/dashboard/profile` renders `Profile` inside the `<Outlet />`
* Same for `/dashboard/settings`

---

### 🔄 Recap of Nested Routing Flow

1. Define nested routes inside a parent `<Route>`
2. Use relative paths (no slashes) for child routes
3. Render nested content using `<Outlet />` in the parent component

---

### 🧠 Why Nested Routes?

Nested routes are useful when:

* You want to **reuse layout** but change content
* Your app has sections with multiple subpages (dashboard, account, settings, admin)
* You need better structure for large apps

---

### 🧪 Advanced Example: Nested with Index Route

Sometimes you want something to render **by default** inside a nested route, like a "welcome page".

```tsx
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
  <Route index element={<Welcome />} />
  <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
</Route>
```

Here:

* `/dashboard` will show `<Welcome />` by default
* `/dashboard/profile` will show `<Profile />`

### 🚧 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                              | Result                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Forgetting `<Outlet />`                              | Nested routes never render         |
| Using `/profile` instead of `profile` in nested path | Becomes a root route, not nested   |
| Using `Link to="/profile"` inside Dashboard          | Goes outside the dashboard context |

---

### 🔚 Summary

* **Route Matching** is how React Router picks the right component based on URL
* All routes match **exactly** in v6+
* **Nested Routes** let you build layouts with subpages inside
* Use `<Outlet />` as a placeholder for rendering nested routes
* Perfect for dashboards, admin panels, or multi-step forms
