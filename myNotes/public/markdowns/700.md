### 🧭 Building Microfrontend Apps / **Handling Routing in Microfrontend Applications**

---

Routing in a Microfrontend (MFE) architecture is one of the **most critical design concerns**, as it involves managing **navigation across independently deployed applications** that must still feel like a unified whole.

---

## 🔹 Types of Routing Strategies

### 1. **Centralized (Shell-Owned) Routing**

* The host (shell) app owns the **entire route config**.
* Based on the URL path, it loads and mounts the appropriate remote MFE using lazy-loading.

✅ **Pros**:

* Full control over routing from the shell
* Enables smooth transitions between MFEs

⚠️ **Cons**:

* Tight coupling between shell and MFE routes
* MFEs become less autonomous

#### 📦 Example:

```tsx
// Shell App
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<RemoteDashboard />} />
<Route path="/settings/*" element={<RemoteSettings />} />
```

---

### 2. **Decentralized (Self-Managed) Routing**

* Each MFE manages its **own routing internally**.
* Shell just loads the MFE container, which then handles sub-routes like `/settings/profile`.

✅ **Pros**:

* Loose coupling
* Easier to develop/deploy MFEs independently

⚠️ **Cons**:

* Nested routing complexity
* Harder to coordinate redirects and shared nav

---

### 3. **Hybrid Routing (Best Practice)**

* The **shell controls top-level routes** (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/settings`)
* Each MFE **manages its internal child routes** (e.g., `/settings/profile`, `/settings/notifications`)

> 🧠 Think of it like **domain boundaries**: Shell handles navigation between domains, and MFEs handle navigation within their domain.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques

### 🔸 React Router (v6+)

* Works well in both host and remote apps
* Supports **lazy routes**, `Outlet`, and nested routing

📦 Example:

```tsx
// MFE App
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<SettingsHome />} />
  <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
</Routes>
```

---

### 🔸 Hash-based Routing

Used when MFEs are deployed to **different origins** (subdomains or domains).

* Enables URL-based navigation without full-page reloads
* Avoids server-side routing issues in remotes

---

### 🔸 Communication via Events or Shared Store

If a route change in one MFE must trigger behavior in another:

* Use `window.postMessage`
* Or shared Redux store (if federated)

---

## 🧬 Real-World Example

Suppose you have:

| MFE           | Route Prefix  | Description             |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Shell         | `/`           | Hosts navbar and routes |
| Dashboard MFE | `/dashboard`  | Analytics, reports      |
| Settings MFE  | `/settings/*` | Profile, security, etc. |

### 🔗 Shell (React Router)

```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/dashboard/*" element={<RemoteDashboard />} />
  <Route path="/settings/*" element={<RemoteSettings />} />
</Routes>
```

### 🔗 Settings MFE (Nested Routes)

```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route index element={<SettingsHome />} />
  <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
  <Route path="security" element={<Security />} />
</Routes>
```

## ✅ Best Practices

| Practice                          | Description                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prefix all MFE routes**         | Avoid conflicts by using a unique base path (e.g., `/orders/*`, `/profile/*`) |
| **Avoid global route collisions** | Use `basename` in React Router and scoping                                    |
| **Keep route contracts**          | Document expected paths so shell and remotes agree                            |
| **Use route guards**              | Implement authentication/authorization per MFE or in shell                    |
| **Graceful Fallbacks**            | Shell should show error/fallback UIs if remote fails                          |

## 📌 Summary

| Aspect       | Centralized      | Decentralized | Hybrid (Recommended)  |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Ownership    | Shell            | MFE           | Shared                |
| Flexibility  | Low              | High          | Medium-High           |
| Dev Autonomy | Low              | High          | Medium                |
| Best For     | Tight navigation | Isolated MFEs | Domain-aligned routes |

---

Routing in MFEs is not just about navigation—it’s about **boundaries, ownership, autonomy**, and **user experience**. A well-planned routing strategy enables seamless navigation, independent deployment, and consistent UI behavior across microfrontends.
