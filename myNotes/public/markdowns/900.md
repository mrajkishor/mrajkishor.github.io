let's break down what **shallow copy during backtracking** really means, especially in recursive algorithms like **DFS, permutations, combinations, or subset generation**.

---

### 💡 First, what is a *shallow copy*?

A **shallow copy** creates a **new reference to an object**, but the nested/internal objects inside it are **still shared**.

In JavaScript:

```javascript
let original = [1, 2, [3, 4]];
let shallowCopy = [...original];

shallowCopy[2][0] = 99;

console.log(original); // [1, 2, [99, 4]] ← modified!
```

Only the **outer array** is copied — the inner array is **still the same reference**.

---

### 🔁 Now apply it to **backtracking**:

In backtracking, you often build up a **path**, explore it, then **undo** it to explore the next option.

```javascript
function backtrack(path, choices) {
  if (someCondition(path)) {
    result.push([...path]); // ← shallow copy here
    return;
  }

  for (let choice of choices) {
    path.push(choice);         // make choice
    backtrack(path, choices);  // explore
    path.pop();                // undo choice
  }
}
```

### ✅ Why we use shallow copy in backtracking?

Because without a copy:

* All paths pushed to `result` would be **references to the same `path` array**, which keeps changing.
* You'll end up with all elements in `result` being the **final state** of `path`.

#### 🧪 Example:

```javascript
let result = [];

function backtrack(path) {
  if (path.length === 2) {
    result.push(path);  // ❌ mistake: direct reference
    return;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    path.push(i);
    backtrack(path);
    path.pop();
  }
}

backtrack([]);
console.log(result);
```

✅ Fix:

```javascript
result.push([...path]); // shallow copy — new array with same values
```

---

### ⚠️ But remember:

* If `path` contains objects or arrays (nested structure), shallow copy **does not deeply clone** those.
* For deep structures, you'd need `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` or a custom deep clone.

### 🧠 In Summary:

| Term                           | Meaning                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shallow copy**               | Duplicates top-level structure, inner references remain shared |
| **Why in backtracking?**       | So each recursive path snapshot is preserved independently     |
| **How to do in JS?**           | `[...array]`, `Array.slice()`, `Object.assign({}, obj)`, etc.  |
| **What happens if you don't?** | All paths will end up pointing to the same reference 😱        |
