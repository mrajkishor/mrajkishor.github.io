### **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

---

## 🚀 What is Bellman-Ford Algorithm?

The **Bellman-Ford algorithm** computes **shortest paths from a single source** to all other vertices in a **weighted directed graph**, and **works even when edge weights are negative**.

It is based on **dynamic programming** and can also detect **negative weight cycles** — a feature not supported by Dijkstra’s algorithm.

---

## 🧠 When to Use

Use Bellman-Ford if:

* The graph contains **negative weight edges**
* You want to **detect negative weight cycles**
* You can afford slightly higher time complexity than Dijkstra

---

## 🧮 Core Idea

Bellman-Ford works by **relaxing all edges** up to `V - 1` times, where `V` is the number of vertices. In the `i-th` iteration, it ensures that the shortest path to all vertices that are at most `i` edges away are correctly calculated.

If after `V - 1` iterations you can still relax an edge, a **negative weight cycle** exists.

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Algorithm

### Input:

* Graph `G(V, E)`
* Edge list: Each edge is `(u, v, weight)`
* Source node: `src`

### Steps:

```python
def bellman_ford(edges, V, src):
    dist = [float('inf')] * V
    dist[src] = 0

    # Step 1: Relax all edges V-1 times
    for i in range(V - 1):
        for u, v, wt in edges:
            if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + wt < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + wt

    # Step 2: Check for negative weight cycles
    for u, v, wt in edges:
        if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + wt < dist[v]:
            print("Graph contains a negative weight cycle")
            return None

    return dist
```

## 🧾 Time & Space Complexity

| Measure          | Value    |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Time Complexity  | O(V × E) |
| Space Complexity | O(V)     |

Where:

* `V` = number of vertices
* `E` = number of edges

---

## 🧪 Example

### Graph:

```
Edge List:  
(0 → 1, weight = 4)  
(0 → 2, weight = 5)  
(1 → 2, weight = -3)  
(2 → 3, weight = 4)
```

### Source: 0

### Distances:

* 0 → 0
* 1 → 4
* 2 → 1
* 3 → 5

## ⚠️ Negative Weight Cycle Detection

If after `V - 1` relaxations you can still reduce any `dist[v]`, it means there is a cycle with negative weight.

This is a **unique feature** of Bellman-Ford not found in Dijkstra.

## 🧩 Comparison with Dijkstra

| Time Complexity          | O((V+E) log V)    | O(V × E)            |

## 🔁 Dry Run

**Input:**

* `edges = [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, -1), (2, 0, -1)]`
* `V = 3`, `src = 0`

**Observation:**

* After 2 relaxations, one more edge updates → Negative Cycle Detected

## 📌 Summary

* ✅ Works for graphs with negative edge weights
* 🚫 Doesn’t work if **shortest path needs to avoid cycles** (e.g., real-world roads)
* 🧠 Excellent theoretical tool for GATE
* 🔁 Core operations: **Edge list traversal**, **relaxation**, **cycle detection**
