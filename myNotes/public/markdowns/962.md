## 📘 Relational Algebra – A Foundation for Query Languages

---

### 🔹 What is Relational Algebra?

**Relational Algebra** is a **procedural query language** that operates on **relations (tables)** in a **relational database**. It defines a set of **operations** that take one or more relations as input and produce a new relation as output.

Think of it as the **mathematical backbone** of query processing — the basis upon which SQL is built.

---

### 🧮 Why Use Relational Algebra?

* It is **domain-independent**: works on relations without needing data-specific rules.
* It helps in **query optimization**: database engines internally convert SQL into relational algebra expressions.
* It provides a **formal foundation** for reasoning about queries.

---

### 🔧 Core Properties

* Operates on one or more relations (tables)
* Always returns a new relation as output
* Is **closed under operations**: output of any operation can be fed into another

### 🔷 Types of Relational Algebra Operations

Relational algebra operations are categorized into:

---

## 🔹 I. **Fundamental Operations** (Basic building blocks)

---

### 1. **Selection (σ)** – Filtering rows

* **Syntax**: `σ<condition>(Relation)`
* **Purpose**: Returns only those rows (tuples) that satisfy a given condition.

> Example: `σ age > 21 (Student)` — selects all students older than 21

---

### 2. **Projection (π)** – Selecting columns

* **Syntax**: `π<attribute_list>(Relation)`
* **Purpose**: Returns only specific attributes (columns), removing duplicates.

> Example: `π name, age (Student)`

---

### 3. **Cartesian Product (×)** – Combine all tuples

* **Syntax**: `R × S`
* **Purpose**: Returns a relation formed by pairing each tuple of `R` with every tuple of `S`.

> Example: If `R` has 3 tuples and `S` has 2, `R × S` will have 6 tuples.

> ⚠️ Warning: Use only when needed — result size can explode.

---

### 4. **Union ( ∪ )**

* **Syntax**: `R ∪ S`
* **Purpose**: Returns tuples that are in `R`, or in `S`, or in both.
* Both relations must be **union-compatible**:

  * Same number of attributes
  * Same domain (types)

> Example: Students from 2023 batch ∪ Students from 2024 batch

---

### 5. **Set Difference ( − )**

* **Syntax**: `R − S`
* **Purpose**: Returns tuples in `R` but not in `S`.

> Example: `AllStudents − GraduatedStudents`

---

### 6. **Rename (ρ)** – Renaming relation/attributes

* **Syntax**: `ρ(new_name, old_relation)`
* **Purpose**: Renames a relation or its attributes — useful in self-joins or chaining operations.

> Example: `ρ(T1, Student)`

---

## 🔹 II. **Derived (Secondary) Operations**

---

### 1. **Join (⨝)** – Combining related tuples from two relations

* A **join** is a **Cartesian Product + Selection + Projection**

#### Types of Joins:

* **Theta Join (⨝θ)**: Apply any condition
  `R ⨝ (R.A = S.B)`

* **Equi-Join**: Condition is equality
  `R ⨝ (R.id = S.id)`

* **Natural Join (⨝)**: Automatically joins attributes with the same name

> Example: `Student ⨝ Enrollment` where `StudentID` is the common attribute

---

### 2. **Intersection ( ∩ )**

* **Syntax**: `R ∩ S`
* **Purpose**: Returns tuples that exist in both `R` and `S`

---

### 3. **Division (÷)**

* **Use Case**: "For all" type queries
* **Syntax**: `R ÷ S` — Returns tuples from `R` that are related to **all** tuples in `S`

> Example: Find students who enrolled in **all available courses**
> If `R(StudentID, CourseID)` and `S(CourseID)`, then `R ÷ S` gives required students.

---

### 🧠 GATE Tips

* 💡 Focus on **natural joins**, **difference**, and **division** — often asked in tricky MCQs.
* 💡 Be familiar with **operator precedence** and **query evaluation order**.
* 💡 Learn how SQL queries map to relational algebra (good for reasoning-based questions).

## ✅ Example Query: GATE Style

🧩 Problem:
Retrieve names of students who enrolled in both CS101 and CS102

**Relations**:

* `Enroll(StudentID, CourseID)`
* `Student(StudentID, Name)`

**Step-by-step in Relational Algebra**:

1. Get StudentIDs for CS101 → `R1 = π StudentID (σ CourseID = 'CS101' (Enroll))`
2. Get StudentIDs for CS102 → `R2 = π StudentID (σ CourseID = 'CS102' (Enroll))`
3. Intersection → `R3 = R1 ∩ R2`
4. Join with Student → `R3 ⨝ Student`
5. Project Name → `π Name (R3 ⨝ Student)`

✅ Final Answer: `π Name ( (π StudentID (σ CourseID='CS101'(Enroll))) ∩ (π StudentID (σ CourseID='CS102'(Enroll))) ⨝ Student )`
