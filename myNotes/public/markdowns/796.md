# ðŸ“˜ **Data Link Layer Protocols: Elementary Protocols, Sliding Window, and Error Handling**

---

## âœ… **6.1 Elementary Data-Link Protocols**

Elementary data-link protocols are **basic communication protocols** that operate at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model. They manage the **framing, error detection, and flow control** between sender and receiver.

### ðŸ“¦ Key Concepts:

---

### 1. **Framing**

* **Purpose**: Divide the data stream into discrete units called **frames**.
* **How**: By adding **start and end delimiters**, such as special bit sequences.
* **Importance**: Helps the receiver understand **where each packet begins and ends**.

---

### 2. **Error Detection**

* Uses techniques like:

  * **Parity bits**
  * **Checksums**
  * **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**
* If an error is detected, the frame is either **discarded or retransmitted**.

---

### 3. **Flow Control**

* Prevents the **sender from overwhelming the receiver**.
* Implemented using:

  * **Stop-and-Wait Protocol**: Sender transmits one frame, then waits for an acknowledgment.
  * Ensures synchronized data flow.

---

### 4. **Modes of Operation**

| Mode            | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Simplex**     | One-way communication (sender â†’ receiver only) |
| **Half-Duplex** | Two-way, but one direction at a time           |
| **Full-Duplex** | Two-way simultaneous communication             |

---

### ðŸ§¾ Summary

Elementary protocols are **simple, low-overhead** mechanisms, suitable for **low-speed or unreliable** environments. However, they lack **efficiency and robustness** for high-performance systems.

---

## âœ… **6.2 Sliding Window Protocol**

Sliding Window Protocol is a **flow control and error control** mechanism used for **efficient and reliable data transmission**.

### ðŸªŸ Key Features:

---

### 1. **Window Size**

* A "window" is the **number of frames** the sender can transmit **without waiting** for an acknowledgment.
* **Larger window â†’ higher efficiency** (pipelining frames).

---

### 2. **Flow Control**

* Prevents overflow by allowing the receiver to control how many frames it can handle.
* **Dynamic adjustment** of window size based on receiverâ€™s buffer space.

---

### 3. **Acknowledgment & Retransmission**

* If acknowledgment is not received within a timeout, the sender retransmits:

  * **Go-Back-N**: Retransmits from the **last unacknowledged** frame onward.
  * **Selective Repeat**: Retransmits **only the missing/damaged** frames.

---

### 4. **Advantages Over Stop-and-Wait**

| Feature    | Stop-and-Wait | Sliding Window           |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Efficiency | Low           | High (due to pipelining) |
| Complexity | Simple        | Moderate                 |
| Throughput | Low           | High                     |

---

### ðŸ§¾ Summary

Sliding Window Protocols enhance **throughput and bandwidth utilization**, especially over high-latency links.

---

## âœ… **6.3 Error Handling in Data-Link Layer**

The **error handling mechanism** in the Data-Link Layer ensures **accuracy and reliability** of data transmission over physical media that are prone to corruption.

---

### 1. **Error Detection**

* Detects whether errors occurred in transmitted data.
* Methods include:

  * **Checksum**
  * **Parity bit**
  * **CRC**

---

### 2. **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)**

* Involves retransmission of erroneous or lost data.
* Types:

  * **Stop-and-Wait ARQ**
  * **Go-Back-N ARQ**
  * **Selective Repeat ARQ**

---

### 3. **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**

* Adds **redundant bits** so that the receiver can **detect and correct** errors **without retransmission**.
* Useful in real-time systems (e.g., streaming, satellite communication).

---

### 4. **Error Recovery**

* Retransmits lost/corrupted data.
* Integrates **timeout mechanisms** to resend when acknowledgments are not received.

---

### 5. **Integrated Error Handling in Protocols**

* Protocols like **Sliding Window** embed error detection, correction, and retransmission logic.
* Ensures **high reliability** in packet delivery.
