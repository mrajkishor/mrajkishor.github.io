## 👕 Case Study: MyClothes.com – Building a Stateful, Scalable Web App

**Scenario:**
We’re designing an e-commerce site where people can buy clothes online. Unlike WhatIsTheTime.com, this app is **stateful** — users have sessions, shopping carts, and saved data like addresses. So we can’t afford to lose state between requests.

---

### ✅ Key Requirements

* 💼 Users must keep their **shopping cart** intact across requests.
* 🧠 App must remain **as stateless as possible** to scale easily.
* 🏗️ **Horizontal scalability** is required for handling high traffic.
* 💾 User data (addresses, orders) must be stored in a **persistent database**.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Base 3-Tier Architecture

We start with a classic **3-tier architecture**:

* **Frontend Tier (Client)**: Browsers accessing our app.
* **App Tier**: EC2 instances in an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** across **multiple AZs**, fronted by a **Load Balancer (ELB)**.
* **Data Tier**: User data stored in **Amazon RDS** (relational DB).

Route 53 handles DNS routing to the ELB.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Handling Session State

Since we now have sessions (shopping cart, login state), we can’t treat EC2s as fully stateless anymore. Let’s explore our options:

---

### Option 1: ELB Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

* ELB "sticks" a user to the same EC2 instance for all requests.
* Helps maintain session state **in memory** on the same server.

**✅ Pros**: Easy to set up.
**❌ Cons**: Breaks if EC2 instance dies or scales down. No redundancy.

---

### Option 2: Store Data in Cookies

* Encode the shopping cart in a cookie on the client.
* Server becomes stateless — reads cookie for state.

**✅ Pros**:

* Works with any server.
* Fully stateless architecture.

**❌ Cons**:

* Limited to \~4KB.
* **Security risk**: user can tamper with cookie.
* Heavier HTTP payloads → affects performance.
* You must **validate** cookies on every request.

---

### Option 3: Server-Side Sessions (Recommended)

* Generate a `session_id` for each user.
* Store session data in a central **ElastiCache** (Redis).
* Only pass the session ID in the cookie.

**✅ Pros**:

* Safe.
* Fast (Redis is in-memory).
* Works across instances.

**✅ Bonus**: You can use **DynamoDB** as an alternative to Redis if you want persistence or fallback durability.

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Persisting User Data

User info like address, name, order history goes in a relational DB — **Amazon RDS**.

* EC2s query RDS for user data.
* For frequent queries (e.g., homepage display, profile), we use **ElastiCache** to cache values and reduce DB load.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Scaling Reads

As read traffic increases, we must offload pressure from the DB:

### Option 1: RDS Read Replicas

* Set up read replicas of the RDS instance.
* EC2s send read queries to replicas and write queries to the **master**.

**✅ Pros**:

* Improves read throughput.
* Great for analytical/reporting dashboards.

---

### Option 2: Caching with ElastiCache (Lazy Loading)

* On a user’s first visit, the app fetches data from RDS and stores it in ElastiCache.
* Subsequent requests go directly to cache.

**✅ Pros**:

* Speeds up performance.
* Reduces DB cost and load.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Making the App Highly Available (Multi-AZ)

We make all critical layers **multi-AZ**:

* App servers (EC2s) in Auto Scaling Group across AZs.
* ELB distributes load and does **health checks**.
* ElastiCache is deployed with **Multi-AZ** enabled.
* RDS is configured for **failover** with **Multi-AZ** deployment.

**Result**: If one AZ fails, app continues serving traffic without user noticing.

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Tightening Security with Security Groups

We use **AWS Security Groups** to implement fine-grained access:

* 🔓 Load Balancer only accepts HTTP/HTTPS from the internet (`0.0.0.0/0`).
* 🔐 EC2s only accept traffic from the Load Balancer.
* 🔐 RDS only accepts traffic from EC2 Security Group.
* 🔐 ElastiCache only accepts traffic from EC2 Security Group.

This approach ensures **least privilege** and **isolation between layers**, which is critical for production.

## ✅ Final Architecture Summary

| Layer        | Component                   | Purpose                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Client**   | Web Browser                 | Accesses app, stores cookies         |
| **DNS**      | Route 53                    | Handles domain routing               |
| **Compute**  | EC2 in ASG                  | Application logic                    |
| **Scaling**  | ELB + Auto Scaling          | Load balancing and elasticity        |
| **Sessions** | ElastiCache (Redis)         | Store shopping cart and session info |
| **Database** | RDS (Multi-AZ)              | Stores persistent user data          |
| **Caching**  | ElastiCache + Read Replicas | Reduces DB pressure, boosts speed    |
| **Security** | Security Groups             | Controls who can talk to what        |

### 🔁 Evolution Recap

1. Stateless ELB with sticky sessions (naive approach).
2. Moved to cookie-based session (but insecure).
3. Settled on **server-side session with Redis**.
4. Added **RDS** + caching for performance.
5. Scaled reads with **replicas** + **cache**.
6. Enabled **Multi-AZ**, **Auto Scaling**, **tight security**.

### 🧠 Final Takeaway

Even a simple e-commerce app becomes complex when you scale it properly. The key lesson here is that **state must be externalized** — either into cache or database — for the app to be stateless, resilient, and scalable.
