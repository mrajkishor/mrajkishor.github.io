## ‚úÖ **2.1 What is Network Structure?**

**Network structure** refers to the *physical and logical arrangement* of devices, connections, components, and protocols that make up a computer network. It defines how data flows, how devices are interconnected, and how network resources are accessed and managed.

### üîÅ Components of Network Structure

---

### 1. **Topology**

The **topology** of a network defines how devices are arranged and connected. It can be:

* **Physical Topology**: Actual physical layout of cables and devices.
* **Logical Topology**: The flow of data within the network.

#### ‚≠ê Common Topologies:

| Topology   | Description                                       | Advantages                                                | Limitations                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Star**   | All devices connect to a central hub              | Easy to manage; failure of one node doesn‚Äôt affect others | Hub is a single point of failure        |
| **Bus**    | All devices share a single communication line     | Cost-effective and simple                                 | Difficult to troubleshoot; not scalable |
| **Ring**   | Each device connects to two others forming a loop | Predictable data path                                     | A failure can disrupt the network       |
| **Mesh**   | Devices are interconnected                        | Redundant paths ensure fault tolerance                    | Expensive and complex                   |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of two or more topologies             | Scalable and flexible                                     | Complex design and setup                |

### 2. **Network Components**

Key components include:

* **End Devices**: Computers, smartphones, printers, servers
* **NICs (Network Interface Cards)**: Connect devices to the network
* **Switches**: Direct data within LANs using MAC addresses
* **Routers**: Connect different networks using IP addresses
* **Hubs**: Broadcast incoming data to all ports (less efficient than switches)
* **Access Points**: Wireless connectivity for devices

---

### 3. **Interlinkages**

These define how devices are connected:

* **Wired Links**: Ethernet cables, coaxial, fiber optic
* **Wireless Links**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared

Types:

* **Physical Links**: Actual medium carrying data (e.g., copper wires)
* **Logical Links**: Virtual data flow using IP/MAC addressing

---

### 4. **Protocols**

Rules and standards that manage communication:

* **TCP/IP**: Core suite for internet communication
* **HTTP, FTP, DNS**: Application-specific protocols
* **Ethernet, Wi-Fi**: Define link-layer communication

---

### 5. **Network Layers**

In layered models (e.g., OSI), each layer has specific responsibilities (e.g., physical transmission, routing, data formatting).

| Feature                   | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Topology**              | Defines how devices are arranged (e.g., star, bus, mesh)                    |
| **Components**            | Devices like routers, switches, NICs, servers, clients                      |
| **Interconnectivity**     | Wired (Ethernet, fiber) and wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) communication paths |
| **Protocols & Standards** | Rules like TCP/IP, HTTP, Ethernet ensure device interoperability            |
| **Network Layers**        | Layered architecture (e.g., OSI) ensures modular communication              |
| **Scalability**           | Network should easily grow with added devices and users                     |
| **Redundancy**            | Backup paths/devices (e.g., dual routers) ensure fault tolerance            |
| **Security**              | Uses firewalls, access control, encryption, and IDS for safety              |
| **Management**            | Monitoring, troubleshooting, and configuration via network management tools |
