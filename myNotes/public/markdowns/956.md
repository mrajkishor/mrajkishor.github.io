## 🤔 Why Optimize Context API?

The Context API is super helpful for avoiding prop drilling — but it **can introduce performance issues** if not used carefully.

The main reason?

> **Any time the context value changes, all components consuming that context re-render.**

Even if a consuming component only uses part of the context, it still re-renders when **any** value in the context object changes.

---

## 🚨 Problem Example: Over-rendering

Let’s say we have this context:

```js
const AppContext = createContext();

<AppContext.Provider value={{ theme, user, toggleTheme }} >
  {children}
</AppContext.Provider>
```

Now imagine:

* `theme` changes → all components using `user` **also re-render**
* `toggleTheme` changes → everything re-renders again

This creates **unnecessary re-renders**, especially in large trees.

---

## ✅ Optimization Techniques

Let’s break down the **top strategies** to optimize context performance:

---

### 1️⃣ **Split Contexts for Related Data**

Instead of combining everything in one giant context, split into **smaller, domain-specific contexts**.

```js
export const ThemeContext = createContext();
export const UserContext = createContext();
```

Then use them separately in components:

```js
const { theme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
const { user } = useContext(UserContext);
```

📌 Benefit:
Only the relevant context triggers a re-render when its value changes.

---

### 2️⃣ **Memoize the Context Value with `useMemo`**

If your context value is an object or function, **wrap it in `useMemo`** to prevent unnecessary recalculations:

```js
const value = useMemo(() => ({ theme, toggleTheme }), [theme]);
<ThemeContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
```

Without this, a **new object is created on every render**, causing all consumers to re-render.

---

### 3️⃣ **Lift State Out of Context (When Needed)**

Sometimes it's better to **pass functions via props** instead of putting everything in context.

For example:

* Keep global **config/state** in context
* Pass frequent-updating or tightly-coupled values via props

This limits re-renders to just what needs them.

---

### 4️⃣ **Use Selectors with Third-Party Helpers (like `use-context-selector`)**

React’s built-in `useContext` doesn’t support partial selection. But libraries like [`use-context-selector`](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector) help solve this.

Instead of re-rendering the whole consumer, you can subscribe to **only the slice of state you care about**:

```js
const theme = useContextSelector(MyContext, c => c.theme);
```

This is advanced but powerful in large apps.

---

### 5️⃣ **Use `React.memo` in Consumer Components**

Even if a component consumes context, wrapping it in `React.memo` can avoid re-render **if props haven’t changed**.

```js
const Dashboard = React.memo(() => {
  const { theme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <div>{theme}</div>;
});
```

⚠️ Caveat: Only helps if context value stays stable (see `useMemo` above).

---

### 6️⃣ **Avoid Setting State in Context Unless It’s Shared**

Putting component-local state in context is tempting, but unnecessary. For example:

```js
// ❌ Bad
<ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen }}>
```

If `isModalOpen` is only used in one place, don’t share it — keep it local.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Debugging Performance

Use React DevTools ➝ Profiler tab:

* Look for components re-rendering unnecessarily
* Check which context updates are triggering them

## 🧩 Summary

| Optimization Strategy              | When to Use                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Split Contexts                     | When managing unrelated pieces of state         |
| `useMemo` for value                | When passing objects/functions in context       |
| Avoid unnecessary state in context | For state used only in a few components         |
| `React.memo` on consumers          | To prevent props-based re-renders               |
| `use-context-selector`             | For large apps with fine-grained control needed |

---

## 🚀 Final Thought

The Context API is clean and elegant — but it’s **not a full state management solution** for large, complex apps with deeply nested components.
When used smartly, with the right optimizations, it can give you **the best of both worlds**: simple state sharing and good performance.
