## üß† **Memory-Reference Instructions in a Basic Computer**

**Memory-reference instructions** are a class of instructions that involve **accessing memory** for either fetching operands or storing results. These instructions typically operate using the **effective address** derived from the instruction and may involve **direct** or **indirect addressing**.

Memory-reference instructions are the **core of most instruction sets**, enabling interaction between the **CPU and main memory**, where most data and instructions reside.

## üßæ **Instruction Format for Memory-Reference Instructions**

In a basic 16-bit instruction:

* **Bit 15**: Mode bit `I` (0 = direct, 1 = indirect)
* **Bits 14‚Äì12**: Opcode (3 bits)
* **Bits 11‚Äì0**: Address field (12-bit memory address)

üìò Memory-reference instructions use **Opcode ‚â† 111**.

### üîç Detailed Explanation of Each Instruction

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **AND (Logical AND)**

* **Operation**: `AC ‚Üê AC ‚àß M[EA]`
* **Description**:

  * Retrieves a word from memory using **effective address (EA)**.
  * Performs a **bitwise AND** with the content of the **Accumulator (AC)**.
  * Result is stored back in **AC**.
* **Use case**: Bit masking or clearing specific bits.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **ADD (Addition)**

* **Operation**: `AC ‚Üê AC + M[EA]`
* **Description**:

  * Fetches a word from memory (EA).
  * Adds it to the value in the AC.
  * Stores the result back in AC.
* **Use case**: Arithmetic calculations, counters.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **LDA (Load Accumulator)**

* **Operation**: `AC ‚Üê M[EA]`
* **Description**:

  * Loads a value from memory (EA) into the AC.
  * Overwrites any existing value in AC.
* **Use case**: Brings operands from memory for processing.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **STA (Store Accumulator)**

* **Operation**: `M[EA] ‚Üê AC`
* **Description**:

  * Stores the value from AC into memory at address EA.
* **Use case**: Saves processed data to memory.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **BUN (Branch Unconditionally)**

* **Operation**: `PC ‚Üê EA`
* **Description**:

  * Loads the **effective address** into the **Program Counter (PC)**.
  * Causes the CPU to jump to a new instruction address.
* **Use case**: Control flow change, loops, jumps.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **BSA (Branch and Save Return Address)**

* **Operation**:

  * `M[EA] ‚Üê PC`
  * `PC ‚Üê EA + 1`
* **Description**:

  * Stores the current **PC** (return address) into the memory at EA.
  * Sets PC to the **next memory location**, EA + 1.
* **Use case**: Calls a **subroutine/procedure**, enabling return via saved address.

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **ISZ (Increment and Skip if Zero)**

* **Operation**:

  * `M[EA] ‚Üê M[EA] + 1`
  * If result = 0 ‚Üí `PC ‚Üê PC + 1`
* **Description**:

  * Increments the value at EA.
  * If the result is zero, the next instruction is **skipped**.
* **Use case**: Used in loops and counting logic.

---

## üìò **Effective Address Calculation**

The **mode bit (I)** defines how the effective address (EA) is calculated:

* **Direct addressing (I = 0)**: EA = address field
* **Indirect addressing (I = 1)**: EA = M\[address field]

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Microoperations (Illustrative Example)**

For `LDA` with direct addressing:

```
T0: AR ‚Üê PC
T1: IR ‚Üê M[AR], PC ‚Üê PC + 1
T2: AR ‚Üê IR(0‚Äì11)
T3: DR ‚Üê M[AR]
T4: AC ‚Üê DR
```

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

Memory-reference instructions form the foundation of data movement and logic in basic computers. They bridge the gap between CPU registers and memory, enabling computation, program control, and procedure invocation. Their efficient use is crucial for implementing effective algorithms and instruction flows in any machine-level program.
