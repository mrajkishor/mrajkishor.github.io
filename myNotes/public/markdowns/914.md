# **Saga Watchers and Workers Pattern**

Redux-Saga is all about **controlling side effects** in a clean, testable, and declarative way. One of the most powerful architectural patterns it promotes — and the one used in all mature frontend systems (especially at scale, like Enterprise companies) — is the **Watchers and Workers pattern**.

This pattern is what keeps large codebases **modular**, **predictable**, and **easy to test** — even when you’re juggling 20+ async flows at once.

Let’s break it down like an experienced frontend architect would.

## 🔍 What Is the Watchers & Workers Pattern?

Think of it like this:

* A **Watcher** saga: sits in the background and listens for specific actions (like "FETCH\_USER\_REQUEST")
* A **Worker** saga: actually performs the task (like making the API call and dispatching results)

It’s like:

```
Dispatcher (action) → Watcher (detects) → Worker (does the job)
```

This clear separation gives you:

* Better readability
* Easier testing
* Cleaner control of side effects
* Reusability of workers (can be used by multiple watchers)

---

## 🛠 Basic Structure

```ts
// 🧠 Worker Saga — handles side effects
function* fetchUserWorker(action) {
  try {
    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.payload);
    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_SUCCESS", payload: user });
  } catch (error) {
    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_FAILURE", error: error.message });
  }
}

// 👂 Watcher Saga — listens for dispatched action
function* watchFetchUser() {
  yield takeEvery("FETCH_USER_REQUEST", fetchUserWorker);
}
```

## ✅ Why Use This Pattern?

| Benefit                   | Description                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📦 Separation of concerns | Watchers listen, workers act — cleaner async architecture |
| 🔁 Reusability            | Workers can be reused across multiple flows               |
| 🧪 Easy testing           | You can test each saga independently                      |
| 🔧 Supports composition   | Combine multiple workers inside complex flows             |
| 🧱 Scale-ready            | Keeps large saga files maintainable                       |

## 🚦 Common Watcher Types

Redux-Saga gives you powerful listeners for different behaviors:

| Watcher       | Description                                           | Example Use Case                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `takeEvery`   | Runs every time the action is dispatched              | Search, notifications, logging   |
| `takeLatest`  | Only runs the latest one (cancels previous)           | Login, autosave, search debounce |
| `takeLeading` | Ignores subsequent calls until the first one finishes | Checkout, button spam protection |
| `throttle`    | Limits action firing rate                             | Scroll events, window resize     |
| `debounce`    | Waits until user stops dispatching for a delay        | Live search, filtering           |

---

## 🧠 Enterprise Insight: Choosing the Right Watcher

* `takeLatest` is used **90%** of the time in user-triggered API flows — you don’t want stale data to override the latest.
* `takeLeading` is excellent for **preventing double submits** (e.g., double order or double payment).
* `throttle` is great for **background UI events** like scroll or resize.

---

## 🧪 Real-World Example: Login Flow

```ts
// WORKER
function* loginWorker(action) {
  try {
    const token = yield call(api.login, action.payload);
    yield put({ type: "LOGIN_SUCCESS", payload: token });
    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_REQUEST" }); // trigger another saga
  } catch (err) {
    yield put({ type: "LOGIN_FAILURE", error: err.message });
  }
}

// WATCHER
function* watchLogin() {
  yield takeLatest("LOGIN_REQUEST", loginWorker);
}
```

Now even if the user clicks "Login" multiple times, only the latest attempt is processed.

---

## 🧱 Composing Multiple Watchers

At scale, your app will have dozens of async flows. So you combine your watchers into a **root saga** like this:

```ts
import { all, fork } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { watchLogin } from "./authSaga";
import { watchFetchUser } from "./userSaga";

export default function* rootSaga() {
  yield all([
    fork(watchLogin),
    fork(watchFetchUser),
    // Add more watchers here
  ]);
}
```

* `all()` runs all watchers in parallel
* `fork()` ensures they’re non-blocking
* Each watcher saga can now live in its own file/module — great for scaling

---

## 🧪 Testing Watcher vs Worker

```ts
// ✅ Test the worker independently
test("loginWorker success", () => {
  const action = { payload: { username: "a", password: "b" } };
  const gen = loginWorker(action);
  
  expect(gen.next().value).toEqual(call(api.login, action.payload));
  const token = "fake-token";
  expect(gen.next(token).value).toEqual(put({ type: "LOGIN_SUCCESS", payload: token }));
});

// ✅ Test the watcher just listens correctly
test("watchLogin listens correctly", () => {
  const gen = watchLogin();
  expect(gen.next().value).toEqual(takeLatest("LOGIN_REQUEST", loginWorker));
});
```

---

## 🧰 Extra Power: Watcher-Worker with Cancellation

Want to cancel a task if the user navigates away or closes the modal?

```ts
function* watchUpload() {
  while (true) {
    const action = yield take("UPLOAD_REQUEST");
    const task = yield fork(uploadWorker, action.payload);

    const cancelAction = yield take(["UPLOAD_CANCEL", "UPLOAD_SUCCESS"]);
    if (cancelAction.type === "UPLOAD_CANCEL") {
      yield cancel(task);
      yield put({ type: "UPLOAD_CANCELED" });
    }
  }
}
```

This gives you **complete control** over lifecycle of side effects — from start to cleanup.

## ✅ Summary

| Role        | Does What                               | Tooling Used                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Watcher** | Listens for specific Redux actions      | `takeLatest`, `takeEvery`, `take` |
| **Worker**  | Executes logic or side effects          | `call`, `put`, `race`, etc.       |
| **Pattern** | Keeps logic modular, testable, scalable | Standard at enterprise level      |

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This pattern is **not just a best practice — it’s foundational** to building real-world apps with Redux-Saga. In Enterprise-level systems, you’ll often see:

* One file per watcher
* One worker per business flow
* Global orchestration through `rootSaga`

That’s how large teams collaborate cleanly on async logic.
