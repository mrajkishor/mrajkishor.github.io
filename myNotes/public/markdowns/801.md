## **Unit 11: Presentation Layer in the OSI Model**

### **11.1 Design Issues**

The **Presentation Layer** is the **6th layer** of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. Its core responsibility is to ensure that data sent from the application layer of one system can be read and understood by the application layer of another. The key **design issues** involved in this layer include:

* **Data Format Standardisation:**
  To facilitate interoperability between heterogeneous systems, this layer defines a common format for data representation. It ensures consistent structure and syntax during data exchange across different systems.

* **Data Conversion:**
  Systems may use different encoding schemes like **ASCII**, **Unicode**, or **EBCDIC**. The Presentation Layer performs necessary conversions to match the receiving system’s format.

* **Data Compression:**
  This reduces the size of data before transmission, saving bandwidth and improving speed. Algorithms such as **Huffman Coding**, **LZW**, and **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** are typically used.

* **Encryption and Decryption:**
  For secure communication, the Presentation Layer applies encryption (e.g., **AES**, **RSA**, **SSL/TLS**) before sending data and decrypts it on the receiving end, protecting against unauthorized access.

* **Error Handling and Recovery:**
  It ensures data integrity through mechanisms to detect and correct transmission errors like bit flips, data loss, or corrupted segments.

**Summary:**
The Presentation Layer handles data translation, compression, encryption, and error recovery, enabling accurate and secure data exchange between disparate systems.

### **11.2 Data Compression Techniques**

**Data compression** optimizes storage and transmission by reducing data size. Compression techniques are categorized into two types:

#### **1. Lossless Compression**

Preserves exact original data during decompression. Ideal for text, program files, and sensitive data.

* **Huffman Coding:**
  Assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring characters and longer codes to rare ones.

* **Run-Length Encoding (RLE):**
  Replaces repeated characters or values with a single value and count (e.g., `AAAAB` → `4A1B`).

* **LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch):**
  Replaces common patterns with dictionary-based codes. Used in formats like **GIF**, **TIFF**, and **ZIP**.

#### **2. Lossy Compression**

Eliminates less significant data to achieve higher compression rates. Best suited for multimedia files.

* **JPEG:**
  Removes visually redundant data in images.

* **MP3:**
  Uses psychoacoustic models to discard inaudible frequencies in audio files.

* **MPEG:**
  Applies techniques like Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and motion estimation to compress videos.

**Use Cases:**

* **Lossless:** Medical data, source code, legal documents.
* **Lossy:** Images, videos, music where perfect accuracy is not critical.

**Trade-off:**
Higher compression ratio vs. acceptable loss in quality.

### **11.3 Cryptography**

Cryptography in the Presentation Layer ensures **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authentication** of data during transmission.

#### **1. Encryption & Decryption**

* **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** Symmetric key encryption, widely used and secure.
* **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman):** Asymmetric encryption using public/private key pairs.
* **SSL/TLS:** Secure communication protocols using encryption.

#### **2. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

* Uses a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.
* Facilitates **secure data exchange** over untrusted networks.

#### **3. Hash Functions**

* Generate a **fixed-size digest** from input data (e.g., SHA-256).
* Used for **data integrity checks** — any change in data results in a different hash.

#### **4. Digital Signatures**

* Created using sender’s **private key** and verified using the **public key**.
* Ensures **authenticity** and **non-repudiation** of the sender.

#### **5. Key Management**

* Involves **generation**, **distribution**, **rotation**, and **revocation** of keys.
* **Diffie-Hellman** is a common protocol for secure key exchange over insecure channels.

**Importance:**
Used in secure emails, e-commerce, banking, and virtual private networks (VPNs).
