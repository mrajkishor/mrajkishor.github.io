### **Binary Division**

Binary division works similarly to decimal (base-10) division, but it's done in **base-2**, using only **0s and 1s**. Among all binary arithmetic operations, **division** is considered the most challenging. However, with the use of **long division**—a method similar to how we do division in decimal—the process becomes easier and systematic.

#### **Basic Rules of Binary Division**

To perform binary division efficiently, keep these simple rules in mind:

| Binary Expression | Result              |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 ÷ 1             | = 1                 |
| 0 ÷ 1             | = 0                 |
| 1 ÷ 0             | = undefined (error) |
| 0 ÷ 0             | = undefined (error) |

> Just like in decimal division, dividing by **zero** is **not allowed** in binary.

#### **Example:**

**Divide**:
`01111100 ÷ 0010`

* Dividend = `01111100`
* Divisor = `0010`

You can safely remove the **leading zeros**, as they don’t affect the value:

* Dividend = `1111100`
* Divisor = `10` (which is **2** in decimal)

---

#### **Step-by-Step Binary Long Division**

We’ll divide `1111100` by `10` using long division:

1. **Start** by comparing the leftmost bits of the dividend with the divisor.
2. If the selected bits are **greater than or equal to** the divisor, write **1** in the quotient and subtract the divisor from those bits.
3. If they are **less**, write **0** in the quotient and bring down the next bit.
4. **Repeat** this process until all bits in the dividend are used.

##### In this case:

```
      111110   ← Quotient
    --------
10 |1111100
   -10
   ----
    111
    -10
    ----
     111
     -10
     ----
      11
      -10
      ----
       10
       -10
       ----
        0 ← Remainder
```

So, the **quotient** is `111110`.

### ✅ Final Answer:

```
01111100 ÷ 0010 = 111110
```

---

### **Summary**

* Binary division follows a process similar to decimal long division.
* Always remember: **division by 0 is invalid**.
* The result is called the **quotient**, and the leftover (if any) is the **remainder**.
* Removing leading zeros makes binary division more straightforward without changing value.
