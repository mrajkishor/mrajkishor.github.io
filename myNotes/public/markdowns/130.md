### **SQL Injection: Understanding and Preventing a Common Web Vulnerability**

SQL Injection (SQLi) is one of the most well-known and dangerous vulnerabilities in web applications. It allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries executed by a database, enabling unauthorized access, data theft, or even database destruction. In this blog, weâ€™ll explore SQL Injection in detail, including how it works, real-world examples, its risks, and how to prevent it effectively.

### **What is SQL Injection?**

SQL Injection occurs when a malicious user manipulates input fields or parameters in a web application to inject SQL code into the database query. This vulnerability arises when input data is not properly validated or sanitized, allowing the injected SQL code to alter the query's intended behavior.

---

### **How SQL Injection Works**

1. **User Input Manipulation**:
   - An attacker provides malicious input into a web application form or URL parameter.

2. **Query Alteration**:
   - The application incorporates the input into an SQL query without proper validation or sanitization.

3. **Execution**:
   - The modified query is executed by the database, performing unintended actions such as retrieving, altering, or deleting data.

---

### **Types of SQL Injection**

#### **1. Classic SQL Injection**
- **Description**:
  - Injecting malicious SQL directly into user input fields.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '';
  ```

---

#### **2. Blind SQL Injection**
- **Description**:
  - The application does not return database errors but provides information indirectly through responses (e.g., true/false conditions).
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'wrongpassword' -- Response: "Invalid credentials"
  ```

---

#### **3. Union-Based SQL Injection**
- **Description**:
  - Combines multiple SQL queries using the `UNION` operator to fetch additional data.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.tables;
  ```

---

#### **4. Time-Based SQL Injection**
- **Description**:
  - Exploits SQL functions that cause delays to infer information about the database.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 'false');
  ```

---

### **Real-World SQL Injection Example**

#### **Vulnerable PHP Code**
```php
<?php
$username = $_GET['username'];
$password = $_GET['password'];

$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
?>
```

---

#### **Exploitation**
- Normal input:
  ```
  username=admin&password=12345
  ```
  Query generated:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '12345';
  ```

- Malicious input:
  ```
  username=admin'--&password=
  ```
  Query generated:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'-- AND password = '';
  ```
  Here, the `--` comment symbol causes the `password` condition to be ignored, logging in the attacker as the user "admin."

---

### **Risks and Impacts of SQL Injection**

1. **Data Theft**:
   - Attackers can extract sensitive information like user credentials or payment details.

2. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Altering or deleting records in the database.

3. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - Gaining administrative privileges.

4. **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
   - Disrupting database operations by overloading it with malicious queries.

5. **Reputation Damage**:
   - Loss of customer trust due to compromised security.

---

### **How to Prevent SQL Injection**

#### **1. Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**
- Prevents SQL code from being treated as part of the query structure.

**PHP Example**:
```php
<?php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password);
$stmt->execute();
?>
```

---

#### **2. Input Validation**
- Ensure all user inputs conform to expected formats.
- Reject inputs containing special characters like `;`, `'`, or `--`.

**Example**:
```php
if (!ctype_alnum($username)) {
    die("Invalid input");
}
```

---

#### **3. Escape User Inputs**
- Sanitize user inputs by escaping special characters.

**Example**:
```php
$username = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $username);
$password = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $password);
```

---

#### **4. Use Stored Procedures**
- Encapsulate SQL logic in stored procedures to avoid direct query construction.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetUser(IN username VARCHAR(50), IN password VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = username AND password = password;
END;
```

---

#### **5. Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**
- Use a WAF to filter and block malicious requests.

---

#### **6. Limit Database Privileges**
- Grant only necessary permissions to reduce potential damage.

---

#### **7. Use ORM Frameworks**
- Use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like SQLAlchemy (Python) or Hibernate (Java) that handle SQL injection risks.

---

### **Detecting SQL Injection**

1. **Automated Tools**:
   - Use tools like **SQLMap**, **Burp Suite**, or **Acunetix** to test for vulnerabilities.

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Inject payloads such as:
     ```sql
     ' OR '1'='1
     ```

3. **Monitoring Logs**:
   - Analyze database query logs for suspicious patterns.

---

### **Best Practices for SQL Injection Prevention**

1. **Use HTTPS**:
   - Encrypt data transmitted between client and server.

2. **Keep Software Updated**:
   - Regularly update databases, frameworks, and libraries to patch vulnerabilities.

3. **Test Regularly**:
   - Perform regular security audits and penetration tests.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Avoid displaying database errors to users.

---

### **SQL Injection Example with Mitigation**

#### **Vulnerable Code**
```php
<?php
$username = $_GET['username'];
$password = $_GET['password'];

$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
?>
```

#### **Secure Code**
```php
<?php
// Using prepared statements
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
?>
```
