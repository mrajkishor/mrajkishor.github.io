### üîπ Topic: **Stacks (Array and Linked List Based Implementation)**

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. It is widely used in recursion handling, parsing, backtracking, and expression evaluation ‚Äî all of which are tested in **GATE DA**.

---

## üîπ 1. **Stack Operations**

| Operation   | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `push(x)`   | Inserts `x` on top of stack             |
| `pop()`     | Removes and returns top element         |
| `peek()`    | Returns top element without removing it |
| `isEmpty()` | Checks if stack is empty                |

> Time complexity for all operations is **O(1)** (amortized) for both implementations.

---

## üîπ 2. **Stack Using Arrays (Python List)**

Python‚Äôs built-in `list` can be used as a stack with `append()` and `pop()` from the end.

```python
stack = []

stack.append(10)      # push
stack.append(20)

print(stack.pop())    # 20
print(stack[-1])      # peek: 10
print(not stack)      # isEmpty: False
```

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* Simple and efficient
* Built-in dynamic resizing

### ‚ùå Cons:

* Fixed size in some languages (C, Java)
* Resizing (if not supported) may cause `Overflow`

---

## üîπ 3. **Stack Using Linked List**

When dynamic memory management is needed, **linked list-based stacks** are preferred.

### ‚úÖ Node Structure:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

### ‚úÖ Stack Class:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.top = None

    def push(self, value):
        node = Node(value)
        node.next = self.top
        self.top = node

    def pop(self):
        if not self.top:
            raise IndexError("Stack Underflow")
        val = self.top.data
        self.top = self.top.next
        return val

    def peek(self):
        if not self.top:
            return None
        return self.top.data
```

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* No size limitation
* Efficient insert/delete at head

### ‚ùå Cons:

* Extra memory for pointers
* Slightly more complex to implement

## üîπ 4. **Comparison: Array vs Linked List Implementation**

| Feature      | Array-Based         | Linked List-Based      |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Memory usage | Less (no pointers)  | More (stores links)    |
| Access time  | Fast (contiguous)   | Slower (sequential)    |
| Size limit   | Fixed/pre-allocated | Dynamic                |
| Overflow     | Possible            | Not unless memory full |
| Underflow    | Must be checked     | Must be checked        |

---

## üîπ 5. **Applications of Stack (Important for GATE)**

| Application                            | Notes                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Expression evaluation (postfix, infix) | Use stack to evaluate operands  |
| Function call stack (recursion)        | System maintains implicit stack |
| Backtracking (DFS, maze solving)       | Tracks path choices             |
| Undo mechanisms in editors             | Save operations to stack        |
| Balanced parentheses checker           | Classic stack-based problem     |

---

## üîπ 6. **Common GATE Pitfalls**

* Stack underflow/overflow conditions
* Popping from empty stack
* Mistaking peek vs pop
* Modifying list during iteration
* Off-by-one indexing in recursive problems

---

## üîπ 7. **Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation   | Array-Based | Linked List-Based       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `push()`    | O(1)        | O(1)                    |
| `pop()`     | O(1)        | O(1)                    |
| `peek()`    | O(1)        | O(1)                    |
| Space usage | O(n)        | O(n) + pointer overhead |

## üß™ Example GATE-Level MCQs

### Q1: What is the output?

```python
stack = []
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
print(stack.pop())
print(stack[-1])
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
2
1
```

---

### Q2: What happens if you pop from an empty stack in a linked list implementation?

‚úÖ Output: Raises `IndexError` or returns `None` based on implementation

---

### Q3: Which is more memory efficient ‚Äî array-based or linked list-based stack?

‚úÖ Answer: **Array-based**, because it avoids pointer overhead.
