### 📌 What is User Mode vs Kernel Mode?

Modern operating systems operate in **two distinct modes**:

1. **User Mode**
2. **Kernel Mode** (also called Supervisor Mode or Privileged Mode)

These modes are part of the **CPU's protection mechanism**, designed to prevent user programs from directly accessing **critical resources** (like hardware, kernel memory, or privileged instructions).

## 🧠 1. User Mode

🟢 This is the **normal mode** in which all **user applications** run (e.g., your C code, browser, editor, etc.).

### 🔐 Characteristics:

* **Restricted access** to CPU instructions and hardware
* Cannot directly access:

  * Disk I/O
  * Kernel memory
  * Hardware devices
* Must use **system calls** to request services from the OS
* A crash in user mode **only affects that program**

📌 Example:
When you call `read()` in C, the program is in **user mode**, and this call triggers a **system call** to enter **kernel mode** temporarily.

---

## 🛡️ 2. Kernel Mode

🔴 This is the **privileged mode** in which the **operating system kernel** executes.

### ⚙️ Characteristics:

* Full access to:

  * **CPU instructions** (like `hlt`, `cli`)
  * **Hardware devices** (disk, RAM, keyboard)
  * **All system memory**
* Can execute **privileged instructions**
* Handles:

  * Process scheduling
  * Memory management
  * File systems
  * Interrupts and exceptions
* A crash in kernel mode can **crash the entire OS**

📌 Example:
The OS executes `read()` by switching to kernel mode to access the disk and fetch the required bytes.

---

## 🔄 Switching Between Modes

The system switches from user mode to kernel mode when:

* A **system call** is made (e.g., `read()`, `fork()`)
* An **interrupt** occurs (e.g., timer interrupt, I/O completion)
* An **exception** occurs (e.g., divide by zero, page fault)

The switch back to user mode occurs after the kernel finishes the requested service and returns control to the user program.

---

## ⚙️ How is the Switch Performed?

* The **CPU has a mode bit (0 = kernel, 1 = user)**.
* When a **trap or interrupt** occurs, hardware switches this bit to 0 (kernel).
* On `return from syscall`, it flips back to 1 (user).

## 🧪 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you're in a museum:

* **User Mode**: You're a visitor; you can look but not touch.
* **Kernel Mode**: You're the staff; you can unlock doors, handle tools, and access restricted zones.

| Access to Hardware  | ❌ No direct access | ✅ Full access                           |
| System Calls Needed | ✅ Yes              | ❌ Not needed                            |
| Crashes Affect      | Just the process   | Entire OS                               |
| Executes            | User programs      | OS Kernel, device drivers, system calls |

### 🔁 Final Takeaway

🔒 **User mode protects system stability**
🛠️ **Kernel mode handles core operations**
💡 The switch between them ensures **security, reliability, and controlled access** to system resources.
