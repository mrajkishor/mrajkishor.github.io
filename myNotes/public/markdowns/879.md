## 📘 Sum of Minterms

In **Boolean algebra**, the **Sum of Minterms** refers to a canonical representation of a Boolean function where the function is expressed as the **sum (OR)** of its **minterms**—also called the **Canonical Sum of Products (SOP)** form.

### 🔹 What is a Minterm?

A **minterm** is a product (AND) of all the input variables in either **true or complemented form**, such that the term is **true (1)** for only one unique input combination in the truth table.

For *n* variables, there are **2ⁿ minterms**, each corresponding to one unique row of the truth table where the function outputs 1.

### 🧮 Example: Boolean Function with 2 Inputs

Let’s define a function `F(A, B)` that outputs `1` when either A or B is `1`.

#### 🧾 Truth Table:

| A | B | F |
| - | - | - |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

#### 🟩 Step 1: Identify minterms where F = 1

For rows where F = 1:

* Row 2 → A=0, B=1 → Minterm: A'B
* Row 3 → A=1, B=0 → Minterm: AB'
* Row 4 → A=1, B=1 → Minterm: AB

#### ✅ Boolean Expression (Sum of Minterms):

```
F(A, B) = A'B + AB' + AB
```

### 🔄 Converting SOP to Minterm Shorthand Notation

Each minterm corresponds to a **binary index**, which represents the **row number in the truth table** where the function is 1.

| Minterm | Binary Form (AB) | Decimal Index | Symbol |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| A'B     | 01               | 1             | m₁     |
| AB'     | 10               | 2             | m₂     |
| AB      | 11               | 3             | m₃     |

Hence, the function can be written using **Σ (sigma) notation** as:

```
F(A, B) = Σm(1, 2, 3)
```

This is the shorthand form of the sum of minterms.

### ✅ Key Points

* A **minterm** is true for exactly **one combination** of inputs.
* **Sum of Minterms** = **OR of all minterms** where the output is 1.
* The **Σm()** notation concisely expresses the function using **minterm indices**.
