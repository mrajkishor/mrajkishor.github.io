## 🧠 **Program Control**

A **program** is a sequence of instructions stored at **consecutive memory addresses**. By default, the **CPU executes these instructions sequentially**, using the **Program Counter (PC)** to point to the next instruction. However, in real-world scenarios, programs often require **conditional decision-making**, **looping**, **function calls**, and **interrupt handling**.

To handle such logic, **Program Control Instructions** are used. These instructions can **alter the flow** of the program, causing it to branch, jump, skip, or return.

---

### 🎯 **Features of Program Control Instructions**

* Modify the **normal sequential flow** of instructions.
* Can be **conditional** (based on status flags) or **unconditional**.
* Useful in implementing **decision structures**, **loops**, and **subroutines**.
* Depend heavily on **status flags** (Z, C, S, V).
* Include **branching**, **jumping**, **calls**, **returns**, and **machine control**.

### 📋 **Types of Program Control Instructions**

| Instruction       | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BR (Branch)**   | Unconditional jump to specified address.                                     |
| **SKP (Skip)**    | Skips next instruction; can be conditional or unconditional.                 |
| **JMP (Jump)**    | Conditional jump based on flags to a target address.                         |
| **CALL / RETURN** | Transfers control to/from subroutines (internal or external).                |
| **CMP (Compare)** | Compares two values (typically via subtraction without storing result).      |
| **TEST**          | Performs logical AND on operands but doesn't store result (sets flags only). |

---

### 🚦 **Status Flags (Condition Bits)**

| Flag  | Name     | Meaning                              |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Z** | Zero     | Set if result is zero (Z = 1)        |
| **C** | Carry    | Set if operation generates a carry   |
| **S** | Sign     | Set if result is negative (S = 1)    |
| **V** | Overflow | Set if overflow occurs in arithmetic |

These flags are **set/cleared** after operations like `CMP`, `TEST`, `ADD`, etc., and are checked by **conditional branch instructions**.

---

### 🔀 **Conditional Branching**

Conditional branch instructions examine flag conditions before changing program flow.

| Mnemonic | Branch Condition      | Tested Flag |
| -------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| **BZ**   | Branch if Zero        | Z = 1       |
| **BNZ**  | Branch if not Zero    | Z = 0       |
| **BC**   | Branch if Carry       | C = 1       |
| **BNC**  | Branch if No Carry    | C = 0       |
| **BP**   | Branch if Plus        | S = 0       |
| **BM**   | Branch if Minus       | S = 1       |
| **BV**   | Branch if Overflow    | V = 1       |
| **BNV**  | Branch if No Overflow | V = 0       |

---

### ⚖️ **Compare Branching (Unsigned and Signed)**

#### **Unsigned Comparisons (A - B):**

| Mnemonic | Condition                   |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| **BHI**  | Branch if Higher (A > B)    |
| **BHE**  | Branch if Higher or Equal   |
| **BLO**  | Branch if Lower (A < B)     |
| **BLOE** | Branch if Lower or Equal    |
| **BE**   | Branch if Equal (A = B)     |
| **BNE**  | Branch if Not Equal (A ≠ B) |

#### **Signed Comparisons (A - B):**

| Mnemonic | Condition                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| **BGT**  | Branch if Greater Than (A > B) |
| **BGE**  | Branch if Greater or Equal     |
| **BLT**  | Branch if Less Than (A < B)    |
| **BLE**  | Branch if Less or Equal        |
| **BE**   | Branch if Equal                |

📌 *Note*: A < B is the logical complement of A > B and vice versa. So status bits can be reused via logic inversion.

### 🔁 **Example: Using Compare and Conditional Branch**

```assembly
CMP A, B         ; A - B → sets Z, S, C flags
BZ  label1       ; Branch if A = B
BP  label2       ; Branch if A > B (S = 0)
BM  label3       ; Branch if A < B (S = 1)
```

---

### 🔄 **Subroutines (CALL / RETURN)**

* `CALL addr`: Jumps to subroutine, storing return address.
* `RETURN`: Returns control back to the instruction after `CALL`.

Used to modularize code and reuse logic.

## ✅ **Conclusion**

**Program control instructions** are vital for implementing dynamic execution flows in programs. By leveraging **status bits** and conditional branching, they allow decision-making, looping, and modular execution. Understanding these concepts is key to mastering low-level programming and processor design.

### Examples

Here are **micro-operation formats** and **assembly-level examples** for key **Program Control Instructions**, including **conditional branches, jumps, and subroutine handling**:

---

## 🧩 **Micro-Operation Format and Examples**

### 1. **Unconditional Branch (BR)**

📌 **Instruction**: `BR address`

📘 **Meaning**: Jump to address unconditionally.

**Micro-operation**:

```
PC ← address
```

**Example**:

```assembly
BR 2000   ; Jump to instruction at address 2000
```

---

### 2. **Conditional Jump (e.g., BZ)**

📌 **Instruction**: `BZ address`

📘 **Meaning**: Branch if Zero flag is set (Z = 1).

**Micro-operations**:

```
If (Z = 1) then
   PC ← address
```

**Example**:

```assembly
CMP A, B     ; Compare A and B
BZ equal_lbl ; If A == B, jump to 'equal_lbl'
```

---

### 3. **Skip (SKP)**

📌 **Instruction**: `SKP`

📘 **Meaning**: Skip the next instruction (unconditionally or conditionally).

**Micro-operations**:

```
PC ← PC + 1    ; Skip next instruction
```

**Conditional skip**:

```
If (Z = 1) then PC ← PC + 1
```

**Example**:

```assembly
CMP A, B
SKP Z=1   ; Skip next instruction if A == B
```

---

### 4. **Compare (CMP)**

📌 **Instruction**: `CMP R1, R2`

📘 **Meaning**: Subtract R2 from R1, set flags only.

**Micro-operations**:

```
TEMP ← R1 - R2
Set flags Z, C, S, V based on TEMP
```

**Example**:

```assembly
CMP R1, R2
BNZ not_equal
```

---

### 5. **CALL and RETURN**

#### CALL

📌 **Instruction**: `CALL sub_addr`

📘 **Meaning**: Call subroutine at `sub_addr`.

**Micro-operations**:

```
Stack[SP] ← PC + 1
SP ← SP - 1
PC ← sub_addr
```

**Example**:

```assembly
CALL sort_array
```

#### RETURN

📌 **Instruction**: `RET`

📘 **Meaning**: Return from subroutine.

**Micro-operations**:

```
SP ← SP + 1
PC ← Stack[SP]
```

**Example**:

```assembly
RET
```

---

### 6. **TEST Instruction**

📌 **Instruction**: `TEST R1, R2`

📘 **Meaning**: Perform bitwise AND, set flags, discard result.

**Micro-operations**:

```
TEMP ← R1 AND R2
Set flags Z, S based on TEMP
```

**Example**:

```assembly
TEST MASK, STATUS
BZ no_flags_set
```

---

## 🧪 **Status Flags Usage in Conditional Branching**

| Flag  | Set by     | Branch Example | Meaning                    |
| ----- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Z** | CMP, TEST  | `BZ addr`      | Jump if result is zero     |
| **C** | Arithmetic | `BC addr`      | Jump if carry occurred     |
| **S** | CMP        | `BM addr`      | Jump if result is negative |
| **V** | Overflow   | `BV addr`      | Jump if overflow occurred  |

---

## 🧵 Example: Full Branching Routine

```assembly
CMP R1, R2
BZ is_equal      ; Branch if equal
BC has_carry     ; Branch if carry
BM is_negative   ; Branch if result negative
JMP end          ; Unconditional jump to end

is_equal:
   ; Equal logic
   JMP end

has_carry:
   ; Carry logic
   JMP end

is_negative:
   ; Negative result logic

end:
   ; Continue program
```
