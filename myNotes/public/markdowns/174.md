# **Secondary Indexes in DBMS Indexing**

In a Database Management System (DBMS), indexes are used to improve the performance of data retrieval operations. While **primary indexes** are based on the primary key and organize data in a unique and structured manner, **secondary indexes** provide an additional layer of indexing to support efficient searches on non-primary attributes.

In this blog, we will explore the concept of secondary indexes, their structure, advantages, disadvantages, and real-world examples.

## **What is a Secondary Index?**

A **secondary index** is an auxiliary structure that provides a mapping between a search key and the physical location of the corresponding data in a database. Unlike a primary index, which is tied to the primary key and enforces physical data organization, a secondary index is created on non-primary attributes to optimize queries.

### **Key Characteristics of Secondary Indexes:**
1. **Non-Unique Attributes**:
   - Secondary indexes can be created on attributes that are not unique (e.g., department name or product category).
2. **Logical Independence**:
   - They are independent of the physical storage of data.
3. **Supports Multiple Indexes**:
   - Multiple secondary indexes can be created for different attributes in the same table.
4. **Efficient Queries**:
   - Secondary indexes speed up queries involving non-primary attributes.

## **Structure of a Secondary Index**

A secondary index typically consists of:
1. **Search Key**:
   - The attribute on which the index is created.
2. **Pointer**:
   - A reference to the location of the corresponding data in the primary storage.

### **Types of Secondary Indexes**:
1. **Dense Index**:
   - Contains an entry for every record in the table.
2. **Sparse Index**:
   - Contains entries for only a subset of records, typically pointing to the start of a block.

## **When to Use a Secondary Index?**

Secondary indexes are useful in the following scenarios:
1. **Queries on Non-Primary Attributes**:
   - Optimizing queries that involve attributes other than the primary key.
2. **Frequent Range Queries**:
   - Supporting queries that retrieve records within a specific range of values.
3. **Joins on Non-Key Columns**:
   - Improving join performance when the join condition involves non-primary attributes.

## **Example of a Secondary Index**

### **Scenario**:
Consider an `Employee` table with the following attributes:
- `EmployeeID` (Primary Key)
- `Name`
- `Department`
- `Salary`

#### **Primary Index**:
- Built on the `EmployeeID`.

#### **Secondary Index**:
- Created on the `Department` attribute to optimize queries like:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Department = 'HR';
  ```

---

### **Secondary Index Implementation**:

#### **Data**:
| **EmployeeID** | **Name**       | **Department** | **Salary** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| 101            | John Doe       | HR             | ₹50,000    |
| 102            | Jane Smith     | IT             | ₹60,000    |
| 103            | Alice Johnson  | HR             | ₹55,000    |
| 104            | Bob Green      | Sales          | ₹70,000    |

#### **Secondary Index Table**:
| **Department** | **Pointers**        |
|----------------|---------------------|
| HR             | [101, 103]         |
| IT             | [102]              |
| Sales          | [104]              |

#### **Query Execution**:
To find all employees in the `HR` department:
1. Use the secondary index to locate the pointers `[101, 103]`.
2. Retrieve the records with `EmployeeID = 101` and `EmployeeID = 103` from the primary storage.

## **Advantages of Secondary Indexes**

1. **Improved Query Performance**:
   - Accelerates searches on non-primary attributes.
2. **Support for Complex Queries**:
   - Optimizes range queries, joins, and aggregations on non-primary columns.
3. **Logical Independence**:
   - Multiple secondary indexes can coexist without altering the physical data organization.

---

## **Disadvantages of Secondary Indexes**

1. **Storage Overhead**:
   - Requires additional storage space for the index structure.
2. **Maintenance Overhead**:
   - Updates, insertions, and deletions in the table require updating the secondary index, increasing overhead.
3. **Query Complexity**:
   - If not used judiciously, secondary indexes can add unnecessary complexity and slow down certain operations.

## **Dense vs. Sparse Secondary Indexes**

| **Aspect**           | **Dense Index**                           | **Sparse Index**                        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Entries**           | Contains an entry for every record.       | Contains entries for a subset of records. |
| **Storage Requirement** | High                                    | Low                                     |
| **Access Speed**      | Faster due to direct mapping.             | Slower due to additional block traversal. |
| **Use Case**          | Suitable for frequently accessed queries. | Suitable for large datasets with fewer lookups. |

## **Real-World Applications of Secondary Indexes**

1. **E-Commerce**:
   - Secondary indexes on product categories and price ranges for efficient filtering.
2. **Banking Systems**:
   - Indexes on account type or branch for quick access to customer data.
3. **Search Engines**:
   - Indexes on document metadata (e.g., author, publication date).

## **Example: Secondary Index in SQL**

### **Table Creation**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

### **Creating a Secondary Index**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department
ON Employee(Department);
```

### **Using the Index in a Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee
WHERE Department = 'HR';
```

## **Comparison of Primary and Secondary Indexes**

| **Aspect**            | **Primary Index**                     | **Secondary Index**                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Attribute**          | Based on primary key.                | Based on non-primary attributes.   |
| **Data Organization**  | Influences physical data layout.     | Does not alter physical data layout. |
| **Uniqueness**         | Ensures unique keys.                 | May have duplicates.               |
| **Use Case**           | Optimizes key-based queries.         | Optimizes queries on non-primary columns. |

## **Optimizing Secondary Index Usage**

1. **Limit Indexes**:
   - Create secondary indexes only on attributes that are frequently queried.
2. **Monitor Query Patterns**:
   - Use query logs to identify attributes requiring indexing.
3. **Combine with Clustering**:
   - Combine secondary indexes with clustering to further optimize range queries.

## **Conclusion**

Secondary indexes are an indispensable tool in DBMS indexing, enabling efficient querying of non-primary attributes. While they come with storage and maintenance overhead, their benefits for read-heavy applications outweigh these drawbacks. By understanding their structure and use cases, database designers can leverage secondary indexes to optimize query performance in various applications, from e-commerce to financial systems.
