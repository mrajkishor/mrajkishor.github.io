# 🛡 Middleware in Next.js — Intercept Requests Like a Pro

**Middleware** in Next.js is a powerful feature that allows you to **intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses** before they reach your pages or APIs. It's like having a checkpoint that runs **before rendering** — perfect for tasks like:

- Authentication & access control  
- Bot protection  
- Redirects & rewrites  
- Logging & analytics  
- A/B testing  
- Localization

Let’s explore how Middleware works and how you can use it in both **Pages Router** and **App Router (Next.js 13+)** projects.

---

## 🧠 What is Middleware?

Middleware is a special function that runs **on the Edge** — before a request is processed by Next.js. It doesn’t render a page but can:

- **Redirect** or **rewrite** the request
- Add **headers** or modify the response
- Short-circuit and return custom responses (in some cases)

---

## 🛠 Basic Setup: `middleware.js` File

Create a `middleware.js` file in the **root** of your project (same level as `pages` or `app` folder).

```bash
/my-project
  ├── pages/
  ├── public/
  ├── middleware.js ✅
```

---

## 📦 Example: Redirect Unauthenticated Users

```js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const isLoggedIn = request.cookies.get('auth-token');

  if (!isLoggedIn && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

In this case, any request to `/dashboard` without an `auth-token` cookie is redirected to `/login`.

---

## 🎯 Matching Routes: `matcher`

You can control **where middleware runs** using the `matcher` config in `next.config.js`:

```js
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/admin/:path*']
};
```

This avoids unnecessary processing for public routes like `/`, `/about`, or `/api`.

## 🔗 Use Cases for Middleware

| Use Case                  | How Middleware Helps                             |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Auth Guarding             | Redirect users without tokens                    |
| Role-Based Access         | Restrict access to routes by user role           |
| Geo-Redirect              | Redirect users based on `request.geo.country`    |
| A/B Testing               | Split traffic and serve different pages          |
| Locale Routing            | Set language based on `Accept-Language` header   |
| Request Logging           | Capture headers, IPs, etc. for analytics         |
| API Rate Limiting         | Detect and block abusive IPs                     |

---

## 🌍 Example: Geo-based Redirect

```js
export function middleware(request) {
  const country = request.geo?.country || 'US';

  if (country === 'IN') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/in-home', request.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

## 🧪 Middleware vs API Middleware vs Custom Middlewares

| Feature                   | `middleware.js`            | Custom API Middleware           | Next.js Pages Middleware (legacy) |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Scope                     | App-wide, global            | Only inside API routes           | Deprecated in latest Next.js |
| Execution Context         | Edge Runtime                | Node.js Runtime                  | Node.js                      |
| Use Case                  | Routing, headers, rewrites  | Auth, DB, token validation       | Legacy Express-style APIs    |
| Performance               | High (Edge-deployed)        | Moderate                         | Varies                       |

## ⚠️ Limitations of Middleware

- Cannot **fetch data from databases** (Edge runtime limitation)  
- Cannot use Node.js native modules like `fs`, `crypto` (some are polyfilled)  
- Should be fast — must complete in **under 1.5s** on Edge  
- Can only **read cookies**, not set them (use `NextResponse` headers)

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

✅ Use `matcher` to limit execution scope  
✅ Keep logic **lightweight**  
✅ Use cookies, headers, and URL for decisions  
✅ Pair with **NextAuth.js** or JWT for authentication  
✅ Use Middleware **only when needed** — not as a replacement for all backend logic

---

## 📚 Real-World Examples

### 🔐 Auth Guard
```js
if (!request.cookies.get('token') && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));
}
```

### 🌐 Localization
```js
const locale = request.headers.get('accept-language')?.split(',')[0].split('-')[0];
request.nextUrl.locale = locale || 'en';
```

### 🧪 AB Testing
```js
const group = Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'A' : 'B';
return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL(`/variant-${group}`, request.url));
```

## ✅ Summary

| Feature               | Description                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Location               | Root-level `middleware.js` or `middleware.ts`       |
| Triggered By           | Incoming HTTP requests                              |
| Used For               | Auth, redirects, rewrites, geolocation, logging     |
| Powered By             | Edge runtime (ultra-fast, globally distributed)     |
| Limitations            | No Node APIs or DB calls, must be fast              |

## 🧾 Final Thought

Middleware in Next.js enables you to run **smart, dynamic logic at the edge** — before rendering or API execution even begins. It's one of the key tools for building **secure, localized, and intelligent apps** with minimal latency and no extra server setup.
