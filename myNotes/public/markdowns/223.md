# Understanding Floyd-Warshall Algorithm for All-Pairs Shortest Paths

The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is a fundamental graph algorithm used to find the shortest paths between ==all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph==. It is particularly powerful because ==it can handle both positive and negative edge weights== (but no negative weight cycles) and works efficiently for dense graphs.

In this blog, we will explore the workings of the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, its implementation, different approaches, and analyze its time and space complexity.

## Key Features of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The algorithm iteratively updates shortest paths using a bottom-up approach.
2. **Handles Negative Weights**: Works with negative edge weights but cannot handle negative weight cycles.
3. **All-Pairs Shortest Path**: Computes shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a single run.

### Applications:
- **Network Routing**: Determining the shortest paths in communication networks.
- **Transitive Closure**: Checking reachability in directed graphs.
- **Arbitrage Detection**: Identifying negative weight cycles in financial graphs.

## How Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Works

### Steps:
1. **Initialize Distance Matrix**:
   - Create a matrix `dist` where `dist[i][j]` represents the shortest path from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.
   - Initialize `dist[i][j]` as the weight of the edge `(i, j)` if it exists, or `âˆž` (infinity) if no edge exists.
   - Set `dist[i][i] = 0` for all vertices `i`.

2. **Iterative Updates**:
   - For each vertex `k`, consider it as an intermediate vertex.
   - Update `dist[i][j]` as:
     ```
     dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
     ```

3. **Detect Negative Weight Cycles**:
   - If `dist[i][i] < 0` for any vertex `i`, a negative weight cycle exists.

### Example Graph:
```
     (4)
 A --------> B
 |          /|
(3)      (-2)|
 |          \|
 v           v
 C <-------- D
     (5)
```

**Edge Weights**:
- A to B: 4
- A to C: 3
- B to D: -2
- D to C: 5

## Implementation of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm in Java

### Graph Representation
We use an adjacency matrix representation for the graph.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FloydWarshall {

    final static int INF = 99999; // Represents infinity

    public void floydWarshall(int[][] graph) {
        int V = graph.length;
        int[][] dist = new int[V][V];

        // Step 1: Initialize the distance matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < V; j++) {
                dist[i][j] = graph[i][j];
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Update distances considering each vertex as an intermediate
        for (int k = 0; k < V; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < V; j++) {
                    if (dist[i][k] != INF && dist[k][j] != INF && dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]) {
                        dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Print the result
        printSolution(dist);
    }

    private void printSolution(int[][] dist) {
        System.out.println("Shortest distances between every pair of vertices:");
        for (int i = 0; i < dist.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < dist[i].length; j++) {
                if (dist[i][j] == INF) {
                    System.out.print("INF ");
                } else {
                    System.out.print(dist[i][j] + " ");
                }
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] graph = {
            {0, 4, 3, INF},
            {INF, 0, INF, -2},
            {INF, INF, 0, INF},
            {INF, 5, INF, 0}
        };

        FloydWarshall fw = new FloydWarshall();
        fw.floydWarshall(graph);
    }
}
```

## Example Execution

### Input Graph:
```

   C <---- D
      (5)
```

### Output:

```

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm involves three nested loops over the number of vertices `V`.
- **Total Complexity**: \(O(V^3)\)

### Space Complexity:
- A distance matrix of size \(V \times V\) is used.
- **Total Space Complexity**: \(O(V^2)\).

## Advantages of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
1. **Simplicity**: The algorithm is easy to understand and implement.
2. **Handles Negative Weights**: Works with graphs containing negative edge weights.
3. **Versatility**: Solves the all-pairs shortest path problem in a single run.

## Limitations of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
1. **Inefficient for Sparse Graphs**: For graphs with fewer edges, other algorithms like Dijkstra or Johnson's Algorithm are more efficient.
2. **No Negative Cycles**: Cannot handle graphs with negative weight cycles.

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
- Computes shortest paths from a single source to all other nodes.
- Faster for sparse graphs but needs to be run multiple times for all-pairs shortest paths.

### 2. **Johnson's Algorithm**:
- Combines Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's Algorithms to handle negative weights and improve efficiency for sparse graphs.

## Conclusion

The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is a powerful and versatile tool for solving the all-pairs shortest path problem, especially in dense graphs with negative weights. While it is not the most efficient choice for sparse graphs, its simplicity and ability to handle negative weights make it invaluable in specific applications. By mastering its implementation, you can handle a wide range of graph-related problems effectively.
