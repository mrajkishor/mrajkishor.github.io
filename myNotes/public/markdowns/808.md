### 🧩 What is Entry Point Splitting?

When you're building an app, not every part of it needs to be loaded at once. That's where **entry point splitting** in Webpack comes in.

At its simplest, it means:

> “Let’s start the bundling process from multiple places, not just one.”

Instead of having one big `main.js` for everything, you tell Webpack:

> “These parts of my app are separate — bundle them separately too.”

### 📁 Think of It Like This

Imagine your app has:

* A **home page**
* An **admin dashboard**
* A **public landing page**

Each of these can work independently. Why force the user to download all of them at once?

With **multiple entry points**, you split them like:

```js
entry: {
  home: './src/home.js',
  admin: './src/admin.js',
  landing: './src/landing.js'
}
```

Now Webpack creates three separate bundles:

* `home.[hash].js`
* `admin.[hash].js`
* `landing.[hash].js`

Each page only loads the JS it needs. Way faster, way lighter.

### 🧠 Why It Matters

Without entry point splitting:

* Every route shares one bloated JS file.
* Irrelevant code is downloaded (and maybe parsed) even if it’s never used.

With entry splitting:

* Each page loads only its own logic.
* Shared code (like React) can go into a **common chunk**, reused by all.

---

### 🔍 Where It Shines

* **Multi-page apps** (MPAs)
* **Apps with clearly separated features or teams**
* **When different parts of the app have totally different users** (e.g., customers vs admins)

---

### 🧪 Example Webpack Config

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    marketing: './src/marketing.js',
    checkout: './src/checkout.js'
  },
  output: {
    filename: '[name].bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
```

Webpack builds:

* `marketing.bundle.js`
* `checkout.bundle.js`

Now, your HTML can selectively load only what it needs.

---

### 📌 Real-Life Use Case

In a large-scale product I worked on, we had a vendor portal, an admin console, and a public user dashboard — all in the same repo. Entry point splitting helped us keep:

* **Initial load times down**
* **Teams decoupled**
* **CI builds isolated**

---

### ✅ Summary

* **Entry point splitting** = start Webpack from multiple files
* Helps create **separate bundles** for distinct parts of your app
* Makes initial loads faster by **avoiding unnecessary code**
* Great for **multi-page apps** or large modular systems
