Logical inference is the **engine of reasoning** in logic systems. In **First-Order Logic (FOL)**, it allows us to derive **new truths** from known statements using rules and formal procedures.

Whether you're writing AI algorithms, building rule engines, or proving mathematical theorems — mastering logical inference in FOL is essential.

## 🧠 What Is Logical Inference?

> **Inference** is the process of deriving **logically valid conclusions** from a set of premises using rules of deduction.

In **FOL**, unlike propositional logic, we deal with **quantifiers**, **variables**, and **predicates**, which makes the inference more expressive — and also more complex.

## 🔧 Key Components in FOL

| Term        | Description                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Predicate** | Describes a property or relation (e.g., `Loves(x, y)`)      |
| **Term**      | Constants, variables, or functions                          |
| **Quantifiers** | `∀` (for all), `∃` (there exists)                        |
| **Domain**    | The set of values variables can take                        |
| **Substitution** | Replacing variables with constants or other terms       |

## 🔍 Goal of Inference

> Given a **knowledge base (KB)** and a **query (Q)**,  
> determine whether **KB ⊨ Q** (i.e., Q logically follows from KB).

This is called **logical entailment**.

## 🛠 Techniques for Inference in FOL

### 1. **Forward Chaining**

- **Data-driven**: Start from facts and apply rules to infer new facts.
- Stops when the **goal is reached** or no more inferences can be made.

✅ Common in expert systems.

### Example:
Given:
- `Parent(John, Mary)`
- `Parent(Mary, Sam)`
- Rule: `Parent(x, y) ∧ Parent(y, z) → Grandparent(x, z)`

🧠 Infer:
→ `Grandparent(John, Sam)`

---

### 2. **Backward Chaining**

- **Goal-driven**: Start from the query and break it into sub-goals.
- Tries to **prove the goal** by looking for supporting rules/facts.

✅ Common in logic programming (e.g., Prolog).

---

### 3. **Resolution**

- A **proof by contradiction** method.
- Convert all formulas into **clausal form** (CNF) and try to derive an **empty clause** (⊥).

✅ Sound and complete method for FOL.

---

### 4. **Unification**

- A process to **match** two predicates by finding a **substitution** that makes them identical.

Example:
```text
Knows(x, y) and Knows(John, z)
```
→ Unifier: `{x/John, y/z}`

Unification is used in **resolution** and **backward chaining**.

---

### 5. **Skolemization**

- A step in **converting FOL to CNF**
- Replaces **existential quantifiers** with **Skolem functions or constants**

Example:
```text
∀x ∃y Likes(x, y)` becomes `∀x Likes(x, f(x))
```

Used in automated theorem proving.

## ✏️ Example: FOL Inference Walkthrough

### Given:
1. `∀x (Human(x) → Mortal(x))`
2. `Human(Socrates)`

### Query:
`Mortal(Socrates)`

### Inference:
- From (2), `Socrates` is a `Human`
- Apply rule (1): If `Human(x)` then `Mortal(x)`
- Replace `x` with `Socrates`  
✅ Therefore, `Mortal(Socrates)` is inferred

## 🚦 Soundness vs Completeness

| Property     | Meaning                                                  |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Soundness** | All inferences are correct (only derives valid conclusions) |
| **Completeness** | Can derive every conclusion that is logically valid     |

Good inference systems in FOL are both **sound** and **complete**.

## ✅ Final Thought

> **Logical inference in FOL** is what turns knowledge into conclusions.  
> It's the foundation for machines that **think, reason, and prove**.

Whether you're building an AI, writing logic in Prolog, or studying for GATE, mastering inference in FOL will elevate your understanding of logic-based computation.
