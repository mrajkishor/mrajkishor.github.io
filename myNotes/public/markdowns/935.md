# 🧠 Python: Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference 

One of the most debated topics in Python interviews is:

> “Does Python use pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?”

Let’s clarify it once and for all:

> ✅ **Python uses "pass by object reference" (also called "pass by assignment")**

It’s **not exactly** pass-by-value or pass-by-reference in the strict C/C++/Java sense. Python follows a **consistent rule**:

## 🔑 Key Concept

In Python:

* **Variables hold references to objects**, not the actual objects.
* When you pass something to a function, Python **passes the reference (i.e., object ID) by value**.

In short:

> ✅ You can **mutate** a passed object (like a list or dict),
> ❌ But you **cannot rebind** the original variable in the caller’s scope.

## 🔹 Immutable vs Mutable: The Core Difference

### ✅ Immutable Types (Primitives)

* `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `tuple`, etc.
* **Can’t be changed** — any "change" creates a new object.
* Function can’t affect caller’s variable.

```python
def modify(x):
    x = x + 1
    print("Inside:", x)

a = 10
modify(a)
print("Outside:", a)  # Output: 10 ❌ (unchanged)
```

---

### ✅ Mutable Types (Objects)

* `list`, `dict`, `set`, `class instances`, etc.
* **Can be modified in-place**, so functions can affect them.

```python
def modify(lst):
    lst.append(99)

nums = [1, 2, 3]
modify(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 99] ✅
```

## 🔥 Trick Interview Question

What happens here?

```python
def reassign(lst):
    lst = [4, 5, 6]

nums = [1, 2, 3]
reassign(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [1, 2, 3] ❌ (unchanged)
```

### 🧠 Why?

Because the reference `lst` was reassigned to a new list. That change is **local to the function** — the original reference in `nums` was never updated.

> Python **passes the reference to the object by value**.
> You can mutate the object, but **not rebind** the variable in the caller.

## 📌 Real-World Implications

1. **Avoid Unintended Side Effects**:

   * Always be cautious with mutable arguments. You might accidentally mutate shared state.
   * Use `copy.deepcopy()` or `[:]` to clone when needed.

2. **Function Defaults Danger**:

   * Don't use mutable default arguments!

   ```python
   def func(data=[]):  # Bad
       data.append(1)
       return data
   ```

3. **Immutability is Safety**:

   * Prefer tuples over lists in APIs where you don’t want consumers to change input.

## ✅ TL;DR Table

| Type           | Passed As          | Mutable? | Can Be Mutated Inside Function? | Can Be Reassigned? |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `int`, `str`   | Reference by value | ❌ No     | ❌ No                            | ✅ (local only)     |
| `list`, `dict` | Reference by value | ✅ Yes    | ✅ Yes                           | ✅ (local only)     |

## 🔍 Correct Terminology for Interviews

Don’t say “Python is pass-by-reference” or “pass-by-value”. Instead, say:

> “Python passes **object references by value**. That means functions get a copy of the reference, so they can mutate the object, but can’t reassign it in the caller’s scope.”

That shows you understand the **memory model**, not just the syntax — which is what Enterprise interviewers are looking for.
