### **What is Burnout?**

Burnout is not just about feeling tired; it is a deeper state of being overwhelmed and disconnected. It often stems from chronic workplace stress, but it can also result from personal pressures. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies burnout as an occupational phenomenon, characterized by three main dimensions:

1. **Exhaustion**  
   A constant sense of physical and emotional depletion.
   
2. **Cynicism or Detachment**  
   Developing a negative attitude toward work or feeling disconnected from tasks and colleagues.

3. **Reduced Effectiveness**  
   Feeling less competent or productive, even in routine tasks.
