### 🔹 Topic: **Selection Sort**

---

## 🔹 1. **What is Selection Sort?**

**Selection Sort** is a simple **comparison-based sorting algorithm** that works by **repeatedly selecting the minimum element** from the **unsorted portion** and **moving it to the sorted portion**.

> It mimics the way we sort cards or books by selecting the smallest (or largest) item and placing it in order.

---

## 🔹 2. **Working Principle**

Given an array `arr` of size `n`:

1. Start from index `i = 0` to `n-2`
2. Find the **minimum element** from `arr[i…n-1]`
3. Swap it with `arr[i]`
4. Repeat until the array is sorted

---

### ✅ Example:

Given `arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`

**Pass 1:** Min = 11 → Swap with 64 → `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`
**Pass 2:** Min = 12 → Swap with 25 → `[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]`
**Pass 3:** Min = 22 → Swap with 25 → `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`
**Pass 4:** Already sorted
✅ Final: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`

## 🔹 3. **Python Code (Iterative)**

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
```

## 🔹 4. **Time and Space Complexity**

| Case         | Comparisons | Swaps | Time Complexity | Space |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----- | --------------- | ----- |
| Best Case    | n(n−1)/2    | n−1   | O(n²)           | O(1)  |
| Worst Case   | n(n−1)/2    | n−1   | O(n²)           | O(1)  |
| Average Case | n(n−1)/2    | n−1   | O(n²)           | O(1)  |

> ⚠️ Even in best-case, Selection Sort takes **O(n²)** time because it always scans the rest of the array to find the minimum.

## 🔹 5. **Key Characteristics**

| Feature            | Value                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| In-place           | ✅ Yes (no extra space used)                      |
| Stable             | ❌ No (swapping may break stability)              |
| Adaptive           | ❌ No (does not change behavior for sorted input) |
| Comparison-based   | ✅ Yes                                            |
| Swapping efficient | ✅ Makes at most (n – 1) swaps                    |

## 🔹 6. **When to Use Selection Sort**

* When **memory writes/swaps are costly** (because it minimizes swaps)
* When working with **small datasets**
* For **educational understanding** of sorting algorithms
* **Not recommended** for large datasets due to O(n²) time

## 🔹 7. **GATE-Level Observations**

| GATE Focus Area          | Insight                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Time complexity analysis | Always O(n²), regardless of input              |
| Stability questions      | Selection sort is NOT stable                   |
| Memory efficiency        | In-place, uses constant extra space            |
| Number of swaps          | Always ≤ n – 1                                 |
| Sorting order trace      | You may be asked to show array after each pass |

## 🔍 Summary Table

| Metric                      | Selection Sort  |

## ✅ Final Tips for GATE DA

* Remember: **Selection Sort is simple but inefficient** for large inputs.
* Know the difference between **selection** and **insertion sort** – both are O(n²), but behave differently.
* GATE may test your understanding through **trace, stability, complexity**, or **algorithm step output**.
