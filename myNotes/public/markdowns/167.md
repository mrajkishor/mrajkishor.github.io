# **Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) in DBMS**

Concurrency control is a critical aspect of Database Management Systems (DBMS) to ensure data consistency when multiple transactions operate simultaneously. One of the most widely used mechanisms for concurrency control is **Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)**. MVCC enhances performance by maintaining multiple versions of data items, allowing transactions to execute concurrently without blocking each other.

In this blog, we will explore the concepts, benefits, and examples of MVCC and understand its role in modern DBMS.

## **What is Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)?**

Multiversion Concurrency Control is a concurrency control method that maintains multiple versions of a data item in the database. Each version represents the state of the data at a particular point in time. MVCC ensures that:
1. **Read operations** see a consistent snapshot of the data without being blocked by write operations.
2. **Write operations** do not overwrite existing data immediately but create a new version.

This approach eliminates the need for locking mechanisms for reads and reduces contention between transactions.

---

## **Key Concepts in MVCC**

1. **Snapshot Isolation**:
   - Transactions operate on a snapshot of the database at the time they start.
   - Readers see a consistent view of the data, even if other transactions are modifying the same data.

2. **Timestamps**:
   - Each transaction is assigned a unique timestamp, usually based on the system clock or a logical counter.
   - Versions of data items are associated with the transaction timestamp that created them.

3. **Versioned Data**:
   - Each data item maintains multiple versions, with each version tagged by a timestamp.
   - A transaction reads the version that is valid for its snapshot.

4. **Visibility Rules**:
   - A transaction \(T_i\) can read a version of data \(X\) if:
     - The version was created by a transaction that committed before \(T_i\) started.
     - \(T_i\) does not see uncommitted changes by other transactions.

5. **Garbage Collection**:
   - Old versions of data that are no longer needed are periodically cleaned up to save space.

## **How MVCC Works**

### **Read Operations**
- A read operation retrieves the version of a data item that is visible to the transaction based on its timestamp.
- Reads are non-blocking since they do not require locks.

### **Write Operations**
- A write operation creates a new version of the data item with the current transactionâ€™s timestamp.
- Existing versions remain unaffected, ensuring that other transactions can continue reading without conflicts.

## **Example: Bank Account Transactions**

### **Scenario**:
- **Initial State**: Account Balance \(X = 1000\).
- **Transactions**:
  1. \(T_1\): Reads the balance of \(X\).
  2. \(T_2\): Updates \(X\) to \(X + 500\).
  3. \(T_3\): Reads the balance of \(X\) after \(T_2\)'s update.

### **Execution in MVCC**:
1. \(T_1\) starts and reads \(X\). It sees the version of \(X\) with \(TS = 0\) (initial balance: 1000).
2. \(T_2\) starts and updates \(X\). A new version of \(X\) is created with \(TS = 2\) (balance: 1500).
3. \(T_3\) starts after \(T_2\) commits. It reads the version of \(X\) with \(TS = 2\) (balance: 1500).

- **Snapshot Isolation**:
  - \(T_1\) sees \(X = 1000\) (snapshot before \(T_2\)).
  - \(T_3\) sees \(X = 1500\) (snapshot after \(T_2\)).

## **Advantages of MVCC**

1. **Non-Blocking Reads**:
   - Read operations do not block write operations and vice versa, improving performance.

2. **Snapshot Isolation**:
   - Transactions see a consistent view of the database, avoiding conflicts.

3. **Improved Throughput**:
   - By reducing contention, MVCC allows for higher concurrency.

4. **Deadlock Avoidance**:
   - Since MVCC eliminates most locking mechanisms, deadlocks are rare.

---

## **Disadvantages of MVCC**

1. **Space Overhead**:
   - Maintaining multiple versions increases storage requirements.

2. **Garbage Collection Overhead**:
   - Periodic cleanup of old versions can impact performance.

3. **Complexity**:
   - Implementing and managing MVCC is more complex than traditional locking mechanisms.

---

## **Real-World Applications of MVCC**

1. **PostgreSQL**:
   - PostgreSQL uses MVCC to provide snapshot isolation and reduce lock contention.
   - Versions of data are maintained until they are no longer needed by any transaction.

2. **MySQL (InnoDB)**:
   - MySQL's InnoDB engine supports MVCC for consistent reads and better concurrency.

3. **NoSQL Databases**:
   - Many NoSQL databases like Couchbase and Cassandra use MVCC to manage concurrent access.

## **Comparison with Lock-Based Concurrency Control**

| **Aspect**               | **MVCC**                                | **Lock-Based**                          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Read/Write Blocking**  | Reads and writes do not block each other. | Reads and writes often block each other. |
| **Deadlocks**            | Deadlocks are rare.                    | Deadlocks are common due to locking.    |
| **Space Overhead**       | Higher due to multiple versions.       | Lower since no versioning is used.      |
| **Performance**          | High for read-intensive workloads.     | High for write-intensive workloads.     |

## **Example: E-Commerce System**

### **Scenario**:
- **Transactions**:
  1. \(T_1\): User views the product stock.
  2. \(T_2\): Admin updates the stock quantity.

### **Execution**:
1. \(T_1\) starts and sees the stock as 100 units.
2. \(T_2\) updates the stock to 150 units and commits.
3. \(T_1\) continues to see the stock as 100 units (snapshot isolation).

- \(T_1\)'s read is unaffected by \(T_2\)'s update, ensuring consistency.

## **Conclusion**

Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) is a powerful mechanism for managing concurrent transactions in DBMS. By maintaining multiple versions of data, MVCC allows transactions to execute concurrently without blocking each other, improving performance and ensuring data consistency. Despite its complexity and space overhead, MVCC is widely used in modern databases due to its ability to handle high-concurrency workloads effectively.

Understanding MVCC is essential for database administrators and developers who aim to design scalable and robust database systems.
