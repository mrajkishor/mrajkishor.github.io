### **2.1 Relations and Functions (Natural, Human-Written Style)**

In algebra and set theory, two foundational ideas are **relations** and **functions**—both describe how elements from one set are connected to elements in another.

---

#### **What Is a Relation?**

A **relation** is just a way of showing how elements from one set (say, set A) relate to elements in another set (say, set B). We typically represent relations using **ordered pairs** like (a, b), where `a ∈ A` and `b ∈ B`.

* For example, the relation:
  `{(1, x), (1, y), (4, z)}`
  shows how numbers (1, 4) from set A are connected to letters (x, y, z) in set B.

Relations can have one-to-one, many-to-one, or even no defined structure at all.

---

#### **What Is a Function?**

A **function** is a special type of relation. In a function, every input (from set A) must map to **exactly one output** (from set B). That means you **can’t have an input with two different outputs**.

In simple terms:
👉 One input → One output
✔️ Allowed
👉 One input → Multiple outputs
❌ Not a function

Example:

* `f(x) = x^2` maps every number to a single square value.
* The relation `{(-2, 3), (4, 5), (6, -5)}` is a function because each input maps to only one output.

---

#### **Domain & Range**

* **Domain**: All possible inputs (first elements in ordered pairs).
* **Range**: All resulting outputs (second elements in ordered pairs).

Example:
If the relation is `{(-2, 3), (4, 5), (6, -5), (-2, 3)}`,

* Domain: {-2, 4, 6}
* Range: {-5, 3, 5}
  (duplicates are ignored)

---

#### **Types of Functions (with diagrams in mind)**

1. **One-to-One (Injective)**
   Every element in A maps to a unique element in B.
   ➤ No duplicates in outputs.

2. **Many-to-One**
   Multiple elements in A map to the **same** element in B.
   ➤ Still a valid function (but not injective).

3. **Onto (Surjective)**
   Every element in B is mapped **at least once** from A.
   ➤ No element in B is left out.

4. **Bijective (One-One & Onto)**
   Every element in A maps uniquely to B, and B has no leftovers.
   ➤ Perfect matching.

---

#### **Types of Relations**

Relations don’t have to follow function rules. There are many special types:

1. **Empty Relation**: No element in A relates to any element (e.g., R = ∅).
2. **Universal Relation**: Every element in A relates to every other element in A (i.e., R = A × A).
3. **Identity Relation**: Every element is related to itself: R = {(a, a) | a ∈ A}
4. **Inverse Relation**: For R = {(a, b)}, the inverse is R⁻¹ = {(b, a)}
5. **Reflexive**: Every element maps to itself.
6. **Symmetric**: If (a, b) ∈ R, then (b, a) must also be ∈ R
7. **Transitive**: If (a, b) and (b, c) are in R, then (a, c) must also be in R
8. **Equivalence Relation**: A relation that is **reflexive, symmetric, and transitive**.

---

### **2.2 Counting Techniques – Recurrence Relations**

In mathematics, **recurrence relations** help us define sequences where each term depends on the ones before it. Think of it like a recipe: if you know the last few steps, you can figure out the next one.

---

### **What is a Recurrence Relation?**

A **recurrence relation** is simply a rule that tells you how to get the next term in a sequence using the previous ones. You might also hear it called a **difference equation**—both mean the same thing in this context.

It’s especially useful in patterns, counting problems, or series like the Fibonacci sequence, where each term builds on the ones before it.

---

#### **Real-Life Example: Fibonacci Series**

You’ve probably heard of the Fibonacci series:

```
F(n) = F(n−1) + F(n−2)
```

Each number is the sum of the two before it. You only need the first two terms, and then the rest can be found using the relation.

Another example is:

```
Tower of Hanoi → Fn = 2Fn−1 + 1
```

---

### **General Structure of Recurrence Relation**

If `xₙ` is the nth term in a sequence, then a recurrence relation might look like:

```
xₙ₊₁ = f(xₙ) 
```

Or more generally:

```
xₙ = f(n, xₙ₋₁, xₙ₋₂, ..., xₙ₋ₖ)
```

Here, `k` is how many previous terms are used to calculate the current one. This `k` is called the **order** of the recurrence.

---

### **Order of a Recurrence**

The **order** of a recurrence relation is the gap between the highest and lowest subscript used.

#### Examples:

1. ```
   13aᵣ + 20aᵣ₋₁ = 0  
   → This is a 1st order recurrence (r and r−1)
   ```

2. ```
   8f(x) + 4f(x+1) + 8f(x+2) = k(x)  
   → This is a 2nd order recurrence (x to x+2)
   ```

---

### **Linear Recurrence Relations**

A recurrence relation is called **linear** when all terms are just multiplied by constants and added. It looks like:

```
xₙ = A₁xₙ₋₁ + A₂xₙ₋₂ + … + Aₖxₙ₋ₖ
```

Where A₁, A₂, … Aₖ are constants, and Aₖ ≠ 0.

This is like a formula using only additions and scalar multiplications.

---

### **Solving a Recurrence Relation**

Let’s say we are given:

```
aₙ = 2aₙ₋₁ − 3aₙ₋₂
```

To solve this:

1. Start with the initial values, say a₀ = 1, a₁ = 2.
2. Use the formula repeatedly to get:

   * a₂ = 2a₁ − 3a₀
   * a₃ = 2a₂ − 3a₁
   * and so on…
3. Look for a **pattern** in the answers.
4. Eventually, you might be able to write a **closed-form expression**, which gives aₙ without recursion.

This process often involves some guesswork, comparing the series to known ones like geometric or arithmetic sequences.

---

### **Conclusion**

Recurrence relations are powerful tools when working with sequences or solving problems where each step depends on the previous steps. They're especially helpful in:

* Number theory
* Algorithm analysis (like time complexity of recursive functions)
* Counting and combinatorics
* Real-world problems like compound interest or population growth

### **2.3 Properties of Relations**

In mathematics, a **relation** describes how elements of one set connect to elements of another. If set **A** is related to set **B** through a rule or mapping `f: A → B`, then we define that connection using pairs like `(a, b)` where `a ∈ A` and `b ∈ B`.

Let’s explore key properties that such relations can have:

---

### **1. Identity Relation**

Each element relates only to itself.

📌 **Definition**:
`I = {(a, a) | a ∈ A}`

🔹 Example: For A = {1, 2, 3}, the identity relation is I = {(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)}

---

### **2. Empty Relation**

No elements of the set relate to each other.

📌 **Definition**:
`R = ∅`

🔹 Meaning: No connections exist between any elements in the set.

---

### **3. Reflexive Relation**

Each element is connected to itself.

📌 **Condition**:
`(a, a) ∈ R` for all `a ∈ A`

🔹 Every item must map back to itself.

---

### **4. Irreflexive Relation**

No element is related to itself.

📌 **Condition**:
`(a, a) ∉ R` for all `a ∈ A`

---

### **5. Inverse Relation**

Flip the direction of the ordered pairs.

📌 **Definition**:
If `R = {(a, b)}`, then the inverse is `R⁻¹ = {(b, a)}`

🔁 Swaps domain and range.

---

### **6. Symmetric Relation**

If `a` is related to `b`, then `b` is also related to `a`.

📌 **Condition**:
If `(a, b) ∈ R`, then `(b, a) ∈ R`

🔁 Works both ways.

---

### **7. Transitive Relation**

If `a` relates to `b` and `b` to `c`, then `a` must relate to `c`.

📌 **Condition**:
If `(a, b) ∈ R` and `(b, c) ∈ R` ⇒ `(a, c) ∈ R`

🔁 Follows a chain of links.

---

### **8. Equivalence Relation**

A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

🔷 This kind of relation groups elements into "equivalence classes" that behave like categories or clusters.

---

### **9. Universal Relation**

Every element relates to every other element in the set.

📌 **Definition**:
`R = A × A`

🧠 It includes all possible combinations of pairs within A.

---

### **Domain and Range**

For a relation `R ⊆ A × B`:

* **Domain (R)**: All first elements `a` in `(a, b)`
  📌 `Domain(R) = {a ∈ A | (a, b) ∈ R}`
* **Range (R)**: All second elements `b` in `(a, b)`
  📌 `Range(R) = {b ∈ B | (a, b) ∈ R}`

🧠 Think of:

* **Domain** = all **inputs**
* **Range** = all **outputs**

---

📷 **In the diagram:**

* Set A = {a, b, c}
* Set B = {x, y, z}
* Arrows show mappings between elements → this is a function from A to B.

---

### **2.4 Matrices of Relations – Human Note**

When we want to **visually represent** how elements of one set relate to another, we can use a **relation matrix**. It gives a neat table-like structure that shows us **which elements are connected**.

---

### 🧠 **What is a Matrix of a Relation?**

Let’s say we have:

* Set **P = {1, 2, 3, 4}**
* Set **Q = {a, b, c, d}**
* A relation **R** connects elements of P to Q:
  **R = {(1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,b), (2,c), (2,d)}**

Now, we use a **matrix** to show this mapping.
Each **row** represents an element from **P** (input)
Each **column** represents an element from **Q** (output)

---

### ✅ **Matrix Rules:**

Each cell `M[i][j]` tells us:

* `1` → There *is* a relation between that row and column (i.e., (pi, qj) ∈ R)
* `0` → There *is no* relation (i.e., (pi, qj) ∉ R)

---

### 📊 Matrix from the Image:

|   | a | b | c | d |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

* Row 1 shows 1 is related to a, b, and c
* Row 2 shows 2 is related to b, c, and d
* Rows 3 and 4 show no relations from 3 and 4 to any element

---

### 🔍 Matrix Properties and How to Detect Them:

| Property                | How to Identify from Matrix                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Reflexive**           | All diagonal elements are `1` (M\[i]\[i])       |
| **Irreflexive**         | All diagonal elements are `0`                   |
| **Symmetric**           | The matrix is equal to its transpose            |
| **Antisymmetric**       | For i ≠ j, if M\[i]\[j] = 1, then M\[j]\[i] = 0 |
| **Join (Union)**        | M1 ∨ M2 → Take max of each pair of cells        |
| **Meet (Intersection)** | M1 ∧ M2 → Take min of each pair of cells        |

---

### 🧠 Extra Tip:

If you want to check **symmetric**:
Swap rows and columns → if new matrix = old matrix → it’s symmetric!

---


### **2.5 Closure Operation on Relations – Human Notes**

When working with relations in discrete math, sometimes a relation might not have the **properties** we want—like being **reflexive**, **symmetric**, or **transitive**.

So instead of redefining the relation completely, we **extend it just enough** to make it meet that property. This process is called a **closure**.

---

### 📌 **What Is a Closure?**

Let’s say we have a relation `R`. A closure is just the **smallest possible “bigger” relation** that includes `R` and also satisfies a desired property (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, etc.).

For any closure:

```
R ⊆ Closure(R)
```

We don’t add extra pairs unless they’re absolutely needed.

---

### 🔁 **Types of Closures**

#### ✅ **1. Reflexive Closure**

To make a relation reflexive, we add (a, a) for every element `a` in the set (if it’s not already there).

**Formula:**

```
Reflexive(R) = R ∪ ∆
```

Where ∆ = {(a, a) | a ∈ A}

---

#### 🔁 **2. Symmetric Closure**

To make a relation symmetric, for every (a, b) in R, we ensure (b, a) is also included.

**Formula:**

```
Symmetric(R) = R ∪ R⁻¹
```

---

#### 🔁 **3. Transitive Closure**

This one's a bit more involved. You repeatedly **compose** R with itself until no new elements can be added.

**Transitive(R) = R ∪ R² ∪ R³ ∪ ...**

That’s what your image represents:

> $$
> $$

R^\* = \bigcup\_{i=1}^{\infty} R^i
]

Where:

* `R² = R ◦ R`
* `R³ = R ◦ R ◦ R`
* ... and so on

For a finite set of `n` elements, the transitive closure can be obtained as:

```
Transitive(R) = R ∪ R² ∪ R³ ∪ ... ∪ Rⁿ
```

---

### 🧠 **Example of Transitive Closure**

Let R = {(1,2), (2,3), (3,3)}

* **R²** = {(1,3), (2,3), (3,3)}
* **R³** = {(1,3), (2,3), (3,3)} → No new pairs added
* So, transitive closure is:

```
R* = {(1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (1,3)}
```

---

### 🧩 Summary Table

| Closure Type | Formula           | What it Ensures                         |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Reflexive    | R ∪ ∆             | (a, a) for all a in the set             |
| Symmetric    | R ∪ R⁻¹           | (b, a) exists if (a, b) is in R         |
| Transitive   | R ∪ R² ∪ R³ ∪ ... | (a, c) exists if (a, b) and (b, c) in R |

### **2.6 Equivalence Relations – Human Notes**

An **equivalence relation** is just a special kind of relationship between elements in a set that behaves like **equality** — it groups elements that are "related" in a consistent way.

To qualify as an equivalence relation, the relation must have **three key properties**:

---

### ✅ Properties of an Equivalence Relation

Let’s say we have a relation \~ defined on a set A:

1. **Reflexive** → Every element is related to itself
     For all x in A:
       x \~ x

2. **Symmetric** → If x is related to y, then y is related to x
     If x \~ y, then
       y \~ x

3. **Transitive** → If x is related to y and y is related to z, then x is related to z
     If x \~ y and y \~ z, then
       x \~ z

If a relation satisfies all three, it's called an **equivalence relation**.

---

### 🔁 Notation

The symbol used for an equivalence relation is typically `~` (tilde), meaning “is equivalent to”.

Examples:

* "x ∼ y" can mean "x is congruent to y"
* "x ∼ y" might mean "x has the same absolute value as y"

---

### 💡 Examples of Equivalence Relations

1. **Equality**
     x = x (Reflexive)
     x = y → y = x (Symmetric)
     x = y and y = z → x = z (Transitive)

2. **Congruence modulo n**
     x ≡ y (mod n) means (x - y) is divisible by n
     This satisfies all 3 properties.

3. **Same absolute value**
     |x| = |y| groups numbers like 3 and -3 together.

4. **Same cosine value for angles**
     cos(x) = cos(y) puts x and y in the same equivalence class.

---

### 🧪 Example Problem Breakdown

**Problem:**
Let `F` be a relation defined by:
  x F y **if and only if** x − y is an **integer** (i.e., x and y differ by a whole number)

We are to **prove** this is an equivalence relation on real numbers ℝ.

---

#### ✅ **Step 1: Reflexive**

Check if every element relates to itself:

* x − x = 0 (which is an integer)
  ✅ So, x F x → Reflexive ✔️

---

#### 🔁 **Step 2: Symmetric**

Check if x F y implies y F x:

* If x − y = k (some integer), then y − x = −k (also an integer)
  ✅ So, if x F y then y F x → Symmetric ✔️

---

#### 🔗 **Step 3: Transitive**

Check if x F y and y F z implies x F z:

* x − y = k, y − z = m ⇒
   Add: (x − y) + (y − z) = x − z = (k + m) (still an integer)
  ✅ So, x F z → Transitive ✔️

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Since F is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive,
**F is an equivalence relation on ℝ**.

---

### 📦 Bonus Insight: Equivalence Classes

If we define an equivalence relation like "x \~ y if x − y is an integer", we can group real numbers like this:

* All numbers that differ by an integer belong to the same group (class).
  Example:
   2.1, 3.1, 4.1, ... all are equivalent under this rule
  These form an **equivalence class**.

---

### **2.7 Computer Representation of Relations (Human Note Style)**

Relations between elements of two sets can be represented in various ways to help us understand their structure better—especially when working with computers or solving logic problems.

---

### **1. Relation as a Directed Graph (Digraph)**

Think of each element in a set as a node in a network. If there's a relation between two elements, you draw an arrow from one to the other.

**Example:**

* Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
* Let R = {(1,2), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,3)}

We draw:

* Arrows from 1 → 2
* A loop at 2 (because 2 is related to itself)
* Arrows like 3 → 2 and 4 → 1 to show other connections.

This is useful in graph theory, automata, and data structure visualizations.

---

### **2. Relation as an Arrow Diagram**

This is a more visual way to show connections between two separate sets, P and Q. You draw two vertical ovals and then draw arrows between the elements that are related.

**Example:**

* P = {1, 2, 3, 4}
* Q = {a, b, c, d}
* R = {(1, a), (2, a), (3, a), (1, b), (4, b), (4, c), (4, d)}

You’ll see multiple arrows from different elements in P to the same element in Q (many-to-one), or even from one element to multiple elements (one-to-many).

---

### **3. Relation as a Table**

Tables work great when we want to check quickly whether a pair is in the relation.

* Rows = elements of Set P
* Columns = elements of Set Q
* If (p, q) ∈ R, then we mark an ‘X’ or check in that cell.

**Example:**
R = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, z), (3, z), (4, k)}

|   | x | y | z | k |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 1 | X | X |   |   |
| 2 |   |   | X |   |
| 3 |   |   | X |   |
| 4 |   |   |   | X |

It helps spot patterns or sparsity in relationships.

---

### **4. Relation as a Matrix**

We convert the relation into a binary matrix (filled with 0s and 1s):

* **Rows** = elements of Set P
* **Columns** = elements of Set Q
* If (p, q) ∈ R, mark 1; else 0.

**Example:**
P = {1, 2, 3, 4}, Q = {a, b, c, d}
R = {(1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,b), (2,c), (2,d)}

Matrix:

```
    a b c d
1 [1 1 1 0]
2 [0 1 1 1]
3 [0 0 0 0]
4 [0 0 0 0]
```

This is very useful for programming, especially when working with algorithms or relational databases.

---

**Conclusion:**
Computer representation of relations isn't just about making them pretty—it helps us analyze, compute, and apply logic to real-world problems. Whether using graphs, diagrams, tables, or matrices, each form gives us a unique way to look at the same underlying structure.

### **2.8 Partial Order of Relations and Lattices**

#### **Partially Ordered Sets (POSET)**

A **partial order relation** is a binary relation `R` defined on a set `S` that satisfies three key properties:

1. **Reflexivity**:
   Every element is related to itself.
   ∀x ∈ S, (x, x) ∈ R

2. **Antisymmetry**:
   If x is related to y and y is related to x, then x and y must be the same.
   If (x, y) ∈ R and (y, x) ∈ R, then x = y

3. **Transitivity**:
   If x is related to y and y is related to z, then x must be related to z.
   If (x, y) ∈ R and (y, z) ∈ R, then (x, z) ∈ R

If a relation satisfies all three of these, then the pair `(S, R)` is called a **partially ordered set**, or **POSET**.

#### **Elements in a POSET**

* **Maximal Element**:
  An element `a ∈ A` is *maximal* if there is no element `c ∈ A` such that `a < c`.

* **Minimal Element**:
  An element `b ∈ A` is *minimal* if there is no element `c ∈ A` such that `c < b`.

**Note**: A POSET can have multiple maximal or minimal elements.

**Example**:
From the Hasse diagram provided:

* **Maximal Elements**: `b`, `f`
* **Minimal Elements**: `d`, `e`

---

### **Lattices**

A **lattice** is a special kind of POSET where every pair of elements has:

* A **least upper bound (LUB)**, called **join** (denoted `∨`)
* A **greatest lower bound (GLB)**, called **meet** (denoted `∧`)

#### **Lattice Laws**

Let `a, b, c` be elements in a lattice `L`. Then the following laws hold:

1. **Commutative Laws**:

   * a ∧ b = b ∧ a
   * a ∨ b = b ∨ a

2. **Associative Laws**:

   * (a ∧ b) ∧ c = a ∧ (b ∧ c)
   * (a ∨ b) ∨ c = a ∨ (b ∨ c)

3. **Absorption Laws**:

   * a ∧ (a ∨ b) = a
   * a ∨ (a ∧ b) = a

#### **Duality Principle**

The **dual** of any statement in a lattice is obtained by swapping ∧ with ∨ and vice versa.
Example:
Original: `x ∧ (x ∨ y) = x`
Dual: `x ∨ (x ∧ y) = x`

---

### **Join and Meet Identities**

Here are additional identities involving join (∨) and meet (∧):

* Idempotent laws:
  `x ∧ x = x`, `x ∨ x = x`

* Commutative laws:
  `x ∧ y = y ∧ x`, `x ∨ y = y ∨ x`

* Associative laws:
  `(x ∧ y) ∧ z = x ∧ (y ∧ z)`,
  `(x ∨ y) ∨ z = x ∨ (y ∨ z)`

* Absorption laws:
  `x ∧ (x ∨ y) = x`,
  `x ∨ (x ∧ y) = x`

---

### **Distributive vs Semi-Distributive Laws**

A lattice is called a **distributive lattice** if the **distributive laws** hold:

* `x ∧ (y ∨ z) = (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z)`
* `x ∨ (y ∧ z) = (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z)`

However, **semi-distributive laws** always hold in any lattice:

* `x ∨ (y ∧ z) ≤ (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z)`
* `x ∧ (y ∨ z) ≥ (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z)`

---



### **2.9 Properties of Lattices**

A **lattice** is a special type of partially ordered set (or poset), where for any two elements `a` and `b`, we can always find:

* Their **Least Upper Bound (LUB)**, also called the **join**, written as `a ∨ b`
* Their **Greatest Lower Bound (GLB)**, also called the **meet**, written as `a ∧ b`

---

### **Bounded Lattices**

A **bounded lattice** has both:

* A **greatest element**, usually denoted by `1`
* A **least element**, usually denoted by `0`

#### **Examples**:

1. **Power Set Example**
   The power set `P(S)` of any set `S`, using union (`∪`) as join and intersection (`∩`) as meet, forms a bounded lattice.

   * Here, the **empty set `∅`** is the least element (0),
   * and the **set `S` itself** is the greatest element (1).

2. **Positive Integers under ≤**
   The set of positive integers `I+` under normal “less than or equal to” relation has a minimum (1), but no maximum. So, it is **not** a bounded lattice.

#### **Properties of Bounded Lattices**

For any element `a` in the lattice:

* `a ∨ 1 = 1`
* `a ∧ 1 = a`
* `a ∨ 0 = a`
* `a ∧ 0 = 0`

---

### **Sub-Lattice**

A **sub-lattice** is a subset `L₁` of a lattice `L` that is itself a lattice.
To qualify, it must be closed under join and meet operations:

* If `a, b ∈ L₁`, then both `a ∨ b` and `a ∧ b` should also be in `L₁`.

---

### **Isomorphic Lattices**

Two lattices are **isomorphic** if there's a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between their elements that preserves both operations:

* Join and meet must behave the same way after mapping.

#### **Example (from your figure)**:

The two diagrams I and II show different-looking lattices, but they are **structurally the same**.
A mapping like:
`a → 1, b → 2, c → 3, d → 4`
preserves both the meet and join operations. So, these are **isomorphic lattices**.

---

### **Distributive Lattices**

A **distributive lattice** is one where the join and meet distribute over each other, like in algebra.

That means, for all elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `L`:

1. `a ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)`
2. `a ∨ (b ∧ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ c)`

If either of these fail, the lattice is **non-distributive**.

---

### **Complements and Complemented Lattices**

If `L` is a bounded lattice (has `0` and `1`), then:

* An element `x` is called a **complement** of `a` if:

  * `a ∨ x = 1`
  * `a ∧ x = 0`

If every element in `L` has a complement, then `L` is called a **complemented lattice**.

### **Modular Lattices**

A lattice is **modular** if, whenever `a ≤ c`, the following rule holds:

* `a ∨ (b ∧ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ c`

This property is weaker than distributivity but still useful in many structures like vector spaces.

---

### **Direct Product of Lattices**

If we take two lattices `L₁` and `L₂`, we can form a **product lattice** by pairing their elements:

* The **join** becomes:
  `(a₁, b₁) ∨ (a₂, b₂) = (a₁ ∨₁ a₂, b₁ ∨₂ b₂)`
* The **meet** becomes:
  `(a₁, b₁) ∧ (a₂, b₂) = (a₁ ∧₁ a₂, b₁ ∧₂ b₂)`

This allows us to combine simple lattices into more complex ones.

### **2.10 Hasse Diagram of Partially Ordered Sets**

The **Hasse diagram** is a simplified, easy-to-read version of a **directed graph** that shows how elements are related in a **partially ordered set (poset)**. It's also called an **ordering diagram**.

Let’s break down how to draw and understand it.

---

### **Rules to Draw a Hasse Diagram**

Suppose we have a set `A` with some relation `≤` (like less than or equal to). To create its Hasse diagram:

1. **Use dots instead of circles** to represent elements.
2. **Remove self-loops**: Since every element is related to itself (reflexive), we skip (a, a).
3. **Remove transitive edges**: If aRb and bRc, and aRc is automatically true, skip the edge from a to c.
4. **Place smaller elements lower**: If `a ≤ b`, put `a` below `b` and draw a line straight up (no arrow needed).

So, the diagram is neat, and only shows the **direct or immediate relationships** between elements.

---

### **Example**

Let’s take the set:
**A = {4, 5, 6, 7}** with relation `≤`

The full relation set R would include:

* Reflexive: (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7)
* Comparisons: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7)

Now for the Hasse diagram:

* Remove reflexive pairs (like 4 ≤ 4)
* Remove transitive pairs like:

  * (4, 7) is implied by (4, 5), (5, 6), and (6, 7)
  * So we only draw the "next immediate step" lines.

The **final diagram** is a simple vertical chain:

```
   7
   |
   6
   |
   5
   |
   4
```

This means:
4 < 5 < 6 < 7 — with each number directly below the next.

### **Supremum (Least Upper Bound)**

If you pick a subset A of a poset (say A = {4, 5}), then:

* An **upper bound** is any element that is greater than or equal to all elements in A.
* The **least upper bound (supremum)** is the **smallest** among those upper bounds.

**Example**:
For A = {4, 5}

* Upper bounds: 5, 6, 7
* **Sup(A) = 5** (since it's the smallest one that’s ≥ 4 and 5)

---

### **Infimum (Greatest Lower Bound)**

* A **lower bound** is any element that is less than or equal to all elements in the subset.
* The **greatest lower bound (infimum)** is the **largest** among those lower bounds.

**Example**:
For A = {6, 7}

* Lower bounds: 4, 5, 6
* **Inf(A) = 6** (as it's the biggest one ≤ both 6 and 7)
