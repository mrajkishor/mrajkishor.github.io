## 📌 Priority Interrupt – Detailed Note

### 📖 Definition:

A **Priority Interrupt** system is a mechanism in computer architecture that **determines the order in which multiple simultaneous interrupt requests** are serviced by the CPU. This system ensures that **more critical or time-sensitive devices** (like disk I/O or network interfaces) are serviced **before less critical ones** (like a printer or keyboard).

---

### 🎯 Objective:

When **multiple devices** raise an interrupt at the same time, the priority interrupt system:

* Identifies **which device's request is most urgent**
* Ensures that **higher priority interrupts preempt** lower ones
* **Maintains system efficiency** by avoiding bottlenecks from slow devices

### 🧰 Techniques for Determining Interrupt Priority

There are **three main methods** used to determine interrupt priority:

---

### 1. 🔗 **Daisy Chaining Priority**

#### 🛠️ Concept:

A **hardware-based** technique where devices are connected **serially** in a chain. The interrupt acknowledgment signal propagates **through the chain**, allowing the **first requesting device** in the chain to get serviced.

#### ⚙️ Working:

* Devices are linked one after another.
* The **CPU sends an Interrupt Acknowledge (INTA)** signal down the chain.
* Each device checks:

  * If it **requested an interrupt**, it consumes the INTA and stops propagation.
  * If **not**, it **forwards INTA** to the next device.
* **First device** with a valid interrupt **gets serviced first**.

#### ✅ Advantages:

* Simple hardware implementation
* Inherently prioritizes devices by position in the chain

#### ❌ Disadvantages:

* Lowest priority devices may **experience delays**
* Chain failure or a busy device can block lower devices

---

### 2. 🧮 **Parallel Priority Interrupt**

#### 🛠️ Concept:

This is a **hardware-software hybrid approach** using an **interrupt register** and a **mask register** to manage and prioritize requests.

#### ⚙️ Working:

* Each device sets a **specific bit** in the **interrupt register** when it requests service.
* A **priority encoder** determines the **highest priority bit set**.
* A **mask register** can **disable lower priority interrupts**.
* The CPU services the highest-priority request and clears the bit after handling.

#### ✅ Advantages:

* Fast resolution using parallel hardware
* Allows **fine-grained control** over interrupt servicing

#### ❌ Disadvantages:

* Slightly more complex hardware than daisy chaining
* Costlier due to additional circuitry (priority encoder + registers)

---

### 3. 🔄 **Polling Method**

#### 🛠️ Concept:

A **software-based** technique where the CPU checks each device **sequentially** to identify which one generated the interrupt.

#### ⚙️ Working:

* On receiving an interrupt, the CPU **jumps to an interrupt service routine (ISR)**.
* ISR **polls each device** in a predefined order (e.g., using address lines or status bits).
* When a device responds, the CPU handles its request.

#### ✅ Advantages:

* Simple to implement
* **No extra hardware** needed

#### ❌ Disadvantages:

* **Slower** than hardware-based methods
* Poor scalability with many devices
* **Wastes CPU cycles** in checking non-interrupting devices

### 📊 Comparison Table

| Method            | Type        | Speed  | Hardware Required | Scalability | Preemptive Capability |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Daisy Chaining    | Hardware    | Medium | Low               | Limited     | No                    |
| Parallel Priority | Hardware+SW | Fast   | High              | Good        | Yes                   |
| Polling           | Software    | Slow   | None              | Poor        | No                    |

### 🧠 Real-Life Example:

Let’s say a **keyboard**, **printer**, and **disk** simultaneously raise interrupts:

* Using **daisy chaining**, if disk is first in the chain, it gets served first.
* In **parallel priority**, disk is assigned highest priority via bit position.
* In **polling**, the CPU checks each device in sequence (e.g., disk → keyboard → printer) and services the one that responds first.

---

### 🧷 Summary:

* **Priority interrupts** are essential for handling multiple simultaneous I/O requests.
* They ensure **efficient CPU usage**, **fast response to critical devices**, and **fairness** in servicing.
* **Daisy chaining** is simpler but rigid, **parallel priority** is flexible and fast, and **polling** is cost-effective but slow.
