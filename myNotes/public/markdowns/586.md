# 🚀 Query Optimization with Indexes in MongoDB

MongoDB is designed for performance and scalability, but as your application grows, so do your data and query complexity. Without **query optimization**, even simple operations can become bottlenecks. This is where **indexes** play a crucial role.

In this article, we’ll explore **how MongoDB uses indexes to optimize queries**, how to identify slow queries, and best practices to write index-friendly queries.

## 🔍 Why Query Optimization Matters

In MongoDB, every query either:

* Uses an **index** to jump directly to the required documents (fast), or
* Scans every document in the collection (slow) — this is called a **collection scan**.

Optimized queries:

* Reduce CPU and memory usage
* Improve response time
* Lower cost in cloud deployments

## ⚙️ How Indexes Optimize Queries

An **index** in MongoDB is a B-tree structure that maps field values to document locations. When a query targets an indexed field, MongoDB:

1. Searches the index instead of scanning documents.
2. Narrows down candidates.
3. Fetches only the relevant documents.

> ✅ Without index: **O(n)** time
> ✅ With index: **O(log n)** time

## 🧪 The Query Optimization Lifecycle

MongoDB’s query optimizer:

1. Considers **all available indexes**.
2. Analyzes possible **query plans**.
3. Selects the **cheapest plan** (least resource-consuming).
4. Caches this plan for future identical queries.

You can see this process using:

```js
db.collection.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } }).explain("executionStats")
```

## 🛠️ Practical Examples

### 🔎 1. Without Index

```js
db.users.find({ email: "abc@example.com" })
```

If `email` is not indexed:

* MongoDB does a **COLLSCAN**
* Time complexity: O(n)

---

### ✅ 2. With Index

```js
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 })

db.users.find({ email: "abc@example.com" })
```

* MongoDB does an **IXSCAN + FETCH**
* Time complexity: O(log n)

---

### 🔄 3. Index on Sort

```js
db.orders.createIndex({ orderDate: -1 })

db.orders.find({ customerId: "123" }).sort({ orderDate: -1 })
```

* MongoDB uses the index to both **filter** and **sort**.
* Without the index, sorting happens **in-memory**, which is slow for large data.

## 🧱 Query Patterns and Index Usage

| Query Pattern | Suggested Index                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Exact match   | `{ field: 1 }`                     |
| Range queries | `{ field: 1 }`                     |
| Sorting       | `{ field: 1 }` or compound index   |
| Filter + sort | `{ filterField: 1, sortField: 1 }` |
| Array queries | `{ arrayField: 1 }`                |
| Text search   | `{ field: "text" }`                |
| Geolocation   | `{ location: "2dsphere" }`         |

## 📈 Monitoring Query Performance

### Use `explain()`

```js
db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 1000 } }).explain("executionStats")
```

Look for:

* `stage: "COLLSCAN"` ❌
* `stage: "IXSCAN"` ✅
* `nReturned`: number of documents returned
* `executionTimeMillis`: time taken

---

### Use `db.collection.aggregate([ { $indexStats: {} } ])`

This shows usage statistics of all indexes.

---

### Use MongoDB Atlas / Compass

* Visual explain plans
* Real-time performance analysis
* Index suggestions

## 🚧 Common Pitfalls

| Mistake                                       | Fix                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Querying without index                        | Add single/compound index on queried field(s)       |
| Wrong order in compound index                 | Match query field order with index field order      |
| Sorting not supported by index                | Include sort field in compound index                |
| Indexing low-cardinality fields (e.g. gender) | Avoid — index on high-cardinality fields            |
| Over-indexing                                 | Only index what’s needed — indexes slow down writes |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Use **compound indexes** for combined filter + sort queries.
* Prefer **covered queries** (when index has all required fields).
* Use `partialFilterExpression` for sparse data.
* Use TTL indexes for auto-expiry data (e.g., logs, sessions).
* Avoid indexing fields that rarely appear in queries.

## 📌 Covered Queries: The Fastest Type

MongoDB can satisfy a query entirely using the index, without reading documents.

Example:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1, name: 1 })

db.users.find({ email: "a@b.com" }, { name: 1, _id: 0 })
```

Here, the query and projection are fully covered by the index.

> 🚀 Fastest: No document lookup = blazing performance

## 🔚 Conclusion

MongoDB indexes are your best friend for optimizing queries. A well-indexed query can be **100x faster** than an unindexed one. Use `explain()`, observe your workload, and index smartly — not blindly.

> 🧠 **Rule of thumb**: Index fields used in `find`, `sort`, `join`, or `filter`. Analyze, optimize, and repeat.
