### âœ… **Answer (for a Java + React Full Stack Developer with 7+ years' experience):**

"Sure! Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer with over 7 years of experience, primarily working with Java on the backend and React/Redux on the frontend. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to build scalable, enterprise-grade web applications across telecom, logistics, and manufacturing domains.

I started my career focusing on Java and Spring Boot APIs, but over time, I transitioned into full stack roles where I handled frontend components with React, implemented state management with Redux Saga and React Query, and even led micro frontend migrations using Webpack Module Federation.

On the backend, Iâ€™ve worked extensively with REST APIs, WebFlux for reactive systems, and integrated with PostgreSQL and Kafka. Iâ€™m also familiar with Docker, CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, and AWS basics for deployment.

What really drives me is solving performance bottlenecks and delivering smooth user experiences. I enjoy working in collaborative Agile teams, mentoring junior developers, and continuously upskilling myself â€” currently diving deeper into system design and distributed architectures.

Outside of work, Iâ€™ve also been building a couple of personal projects â€” one of them is a distributed task scheduler with Redis and Kafka, and the other is an inventory management system for small businesses."
