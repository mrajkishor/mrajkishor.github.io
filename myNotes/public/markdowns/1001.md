## **Deadlock Detection and Prevention**

---

### 🚫 What is a Deadlock?

A **deadlock** occurs when **two or more transactions wait indefinitely** for resources (locks) held by each other.
No transaction can proceed — system is **stuck**.

---

### ⚠️ Deadlock Scenario (Classic)

```
T1: LOCK(X)         → wants Y
T2: LOCK(Y)         → wants X
```

* T1 is waiting for T2 to release Y
* T2 is waiting for T1 to release X
* 🔁 **Cycle in wait-for condition** ⇒ **Deadlock**

---

## 🧠 Deadlock Conditions (Coffman Conditions)

All four must hold simultaneously:

1. **Mutual Exclusion** – At least one resource is non-shareable
2. **Hold and Wait** – Holding one lock while waiting for another
3. **No Preemption** – Resources cannot be forcefully taken
4. **Circular Wait** – A closed chain of waiting transactions

💡 *Break any one → prevent deadlock*

## ✅ GATE Focus Areas: **Detection** and **Prevention**

---

## 🔍 1️⃣ Deadlock Detection

> Detect **after it occurs**, then **abort** a victim transaction to resolve.

---

### 🔁 Wait-For Graph (WFG)

* **Nodes** = Transactions
* **Edge Ti → Tj** = Ti is **waiting** for a lock held by Tj
* **Cycle** in the graph ⇒ Deadlock

📌 **Used by DBMS** at runtime to monitor locking behavior.

---

### 🔁 Example:

```
T1 waiting for T2  
T2 waiting for T3  
T3 waiting for T1  
```

Graph: T1 → T2 → T3 → T1
➡️ **Cycle detected** ⇒ **Deadlock present**

---

### 🛠️ Resolution:

* **Abort** one transaction (usually youngest or least costly)
* **Rollback** and release its locks
* Let others proceed

---

## 🚫 2️⃣ Deadlock Prevention

> Prevent system from **entering a deadlock state** by **designing locking rules**.

| Technique                               | Strategy                                    | Key Rule                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wait-Die**                            | Preemptive                                  | If Ti (older) requests resource held by Tj (younger) → **wait**<br>Else → **die (abort)**               |
| **Wound-Wait**                          | Preemptive                                  | If Ti (older) requests resource held by Tj (younger) → **wound (force Tj to abort)**<br>Else → **wait** |
| **Timeouts**                            | Passive                                     | Abort if wait exceeds a timeout limit                                                                   |
| **One-shot Locking (Conservative 2PL)** | All locks acquired at once before execution | If not available → don’t start                                                                          |

### 🧪 Wait-Die Example:

Assume TS(T1) = 10, TS(T2) = 20

* T1 requests X held by T2 → T1 is older → **T1 waits**
* T2 requests Y held by T1 → T2 is younger → **T2 dies (aborts)**

---

### 🧪 Wound-Wait Example:

Same timestamps: TS(T1) = 10, TS(T2) = 20

* T1 requests X held by T2 → **T1 wounds T2** (T2 aborts)
* T2 requests Y held by T1 → **T2 waits**

| Property                | Deadlock                | Starvation        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| All transactions block? | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No              |
| Cause                   | Circular waiting        | Priority policies |
| Solution                | Detection or prevention | Fair scheduling   |

## 📌 GATE Tips

* **Know WFG construction** — GATE often gives wait-for dependencies and asks for cycle detection
* Practice **timestamp comparisons** in wait-die/wound-wait
* Memorize which strategy **prevents**, which **detects**
* Look for **transitive wait edges** when building WFG
