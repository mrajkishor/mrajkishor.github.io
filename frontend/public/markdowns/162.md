# **Properties of Transactions (ACID) in DBMS**

In Database Management Systems (DBMS), transactions play a vital role in ensuring the integrity and reliability of data. A **transaction** is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work, which either completely succeeds or fails. The **ACID properties** are the cornerstone of transaction management, ensuring data consistency, reliability, and robustness, even in the presence of failures.

In this blog, we will delve into the ACID properties—**Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability**—with examples to illustrate their significance.

## **What is a Transaction?**

A transaction is a set of operations that transforms the database from one consistent state to another. These operations typically include **Insert**, **Update**, **Delete**, or **Read**. For example:
1. A bank transfer where money is deducted from one account and added to another.
2. An online order where inventory is updated, payment is processed, and a confirmation is generated.

## **ACID Properties**

The ACID properties ensure that transactions are processed reliably in a DBMS:

### 1. **Atomicity**
Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all the operations in the transaction are executed, or none of them are. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, leaving the database in its original state.

#### **Example: Bank Transfer**
- Transaction: Transfer ₹1000 from Account A to Account B.
    - Step 1: Debit ₹1000 from Account A.
    - Step 2: Credit ₹1000 to Account B.

If the system crashes after Step 1 but before Step 2, Atomicity ensures that Step 1 is rolled back, so ₹1000 is not deducted from Account A.

### 2. **Consistency**
Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. It maintains the integrity constraints defined on the database.

#### **Example: Inventory Management**
- Transaction: A customer buys a product.
    - Step 1: Reduce inventory count by 1.
    - Step 2: Create a sales record.

If the transaction ensures that the inventory count and sales record remain consistent, no product is "lost" or "sold without being available."

- **Before Transaction**:
    - Inventory: 50 items.
    - Sales: 0 items.
- **After Transaction**:
    - Inventory: 49 items.
    - Sales: 1 item.

If any of these constraints fail, the transaction is rolled back to maintain consistency.

### 3. **Isolation**
Isolation ensures that transactions occurring concurrently do not interfere with each other. Each transaction is executed as if it were the only transaction in the system, even when multiple transactions are executed simultaneously.

#### **Example: Online Ticket Booking**
- Transaction 1: User A books 2 tickets from 10 available seats.
- Transaction 2: User B books 5 tickets from the same 10 seats.

If both transactions execute concurrently, Isolation ensures that:
1. User A and User B do not book the same seat.
2. The total seats booked do not exceed the available seats.

==This is achieved by locking the seats for each transaction until it completes.==

### 4. **Durability**
Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure. The database preserves the results of the committed transaction.

#### **Example: Online Payment**
- Transaction: Pay ₹5000 using an online portal.
    - Step 1: Deduct ₹5000 from the user’s bank account.
    - Step 2: Confirm payment and generate a receipt.

If the system crashes after Step 2, the Deduction of ₹5000 remains permanent in the database. This ensures that the payment is not lost, and the receipt reflects the correct status.

## **ACID Properties in Action**

Let’s combine the ACID properties using a comprehensive example:

### **Scenario: Bank Transfer**
- **Task**: Transfer ₹2000 from Account X to Account Y.
    - Step 1: Check if Account X has sufficient balance.
    - Step 2: Deduct ₹2000 from Account X.
    - Step 3: Add ₹2000 to Account Y.
    - Step 4: Log the transaction as successful.

#### **How ACID Properties Work**:
1. **Atomicity**: If any step (e.g., adding to Account Y) fails, the transaction is rolled back, and no money is deducted from Account X.
2. **Consistency**: The total amount of money in the system remains unchanged before and after the transaction.
    - Before: Account X (₹5000), Account Y (₹3000) → Total ₹8000.
    - After: Account X (₹3000), Account Y (₹5000) → Total ₹8000.
3. **Isolation**: If another transaction tries to modify Account X or Account Y during this transaction, it will be queued until this transaction completes.
4. **Durability**: After committing, the deduction from Account X and the addition to Account Y are permanent, even if the system crashes.

## **ACID Properties and Concurrency Control**

ACID properties work hand-in-hand with concurrency control mechanisms, such as:
- **Locks**: Prevent conflicts by restricting access to data.
- **Timestamps**: Ensure transactions execute in a specific order.
- **Isolation Levels**: Provide flexibility in transaction isolation (e.g., READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE).

### **Isolation Levels in SQL**:
1. **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Transactions can read uncommitted data (dirty reads).
2. **READ COMMITTED**: Transactions only read committed data.
3. **REPEATABLE READ**: Ensures that if a transaction reads a value, it won’t change during the transaction.
4. **SERIALIZABLE**: Ensures complete isolation by serializing transactions.

## **Conclusion**

The ACID properties are essential for ensuring reliable and consistent transaction processing in DBMS. They provide a framework for handling complex operations, maintaining data integrity, and supporting concurrent users in a robust manner. By adhering to Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, database systems can ensure that data remains secure and accurate, even in the face of failures or high concurrency.
