# ⚙️ CI/CD Pipelines for Next.js with GitHub Actions  

## 🧭 Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) ensures your Next.js application is **automatically built, tested, and deployed** every time you push code to GitHub. This improves developer velocity, reliability, and confidence in every release.

In this guide, we’ll set up a full CI/CD pipeline for a **Next.js project using GitHub Actions** — from testing and linting to production deployment.

---

## 🚀 What is GitHub Actions?

**GitHub Actions** is a native CI/CD tool offered by GitHub that lets you:

- Automate build, test, and deploy workflows
- Run jobs in containers or VMs
- Define custom workflows via YAML
- Trigger actions on push, PR, tags, schedule, etc.

---

## 🏁 Prerequisites

- A Next.js project pushed to GitHub
- Deployment target (like Vercel, Netlify, or your own server)
- (Optional) Vercel Access Token if deploying programmatically

---

## 📁 1. Create a Workflow File

Inside your repo, create this directory and file:

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    └── ci.yml
```

---

## 🛠 2. Basic CI Workflow Example

Here’s a simple GitHub Actions file that:

- Installs dependencies
- Lints code
- Runs tests
- Builds the app

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Next.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: ⬇️ Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: 🧱 Set up Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: 📦 Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: 🧪 Run Tests
        run: npm run test

      - name: 🧹 Lint Code
        run: npm run lint

      - name: 🏗️ Build Project
        run: npm run build
```

---

## 🚚 3. Deploying to Vercel (Optional)

To automatically deploy to **Vercel** after CI passes:

1. Go to [https://vercel.com/account/tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) and generate a token.
2. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repo:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

3. Update your workflow file:

```yaml
  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ⬇️ Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: 🚀 Deploy to Vercel
        run: npx vercel --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
        env:
          VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

---

## 🔐 4. Managing Secrets

Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → Add:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

This avoids hardcoding tokens or exposing them in code.

---

## 🧪 5. Add Custom Test or Coverage Commands

You can run:

```bash
npm run test -- --coverage
```

And upload coverage reports using `actions/upload-artifact`.

---

## 💡 6. Deploying to Other Platforms

### Netlify
- Use Netlify CLI with access token
- Add `.netlify` folder and `netlify.toml`
- Use `netlify deploy` in the final step

### Firebase Hosting
- Use `firebase-tools` CLI
- Add secrets like `FIREBASE_TOKEN`
- Use `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### AWS S3/EC2
- Use AWS CLI
- Configure AWS credentials in GitHub secrets

## ✅ CI/CD Benefits Recap

| Benefit             | Description                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Automated Testing   | Catch bugs early before merge                         |
| Consistent Builds   | Avoids “works on my machine” problems                 |
| Auto Deployment     | Deploy to production or staging instantly             |
| Fast Feedback       | PRs show test/lint/build status                       |
| Secure Tokens       | Credentials are encrypted using GitHub Secrets        |

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

A reliable CI/CD setup is **essential for modern web development**. GitHub Actions integrates deeply with your Next.js workflow and scales from solo developers to enterprise teams.
