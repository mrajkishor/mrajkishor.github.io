### ◄ Top K / Least K Elements → Use Heap

Finding the **Top K** (largest/smallest) elements is a common problem in DSA, and the most efficient way to solve it is using a **Heap (Priority Queue)**.

---

### ✅ **When to Use:**

* You need to find:

  * **Top K largest elements**
  * **Top K smallest elements**
  * **Kth largest/smallest element**
* The array is **large or streaming**, and sorting is inefficient.

---

### 💡 **Core Idea:**

* Use a **Min Heap** to keep track of Top K largest elements
* Use a **Max Heap** to keep track of K smallest elements
  (Heap size is fixed to **K** to ensure efficiency)

---

### 🧠 **Example: Top 3 Largest Elements**

```javascript
function topKLargest(nums, k) {
  const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue(); // from @datastructures-js/priority-queue or custom heap

  for (let num of nums) {
    minHeap.enqueue(num);
    if (minHeap.size() > k) minHeap.dequeue(); // remove smallest
  }

  return minHeap.toArray().map(e => e.element); // top K largest
}
```

In native JS, use `nums.sort((a, b) => b - a).slice(0, k)` but it’s **O(n log n)**. Heap-based is **O(n log k)** — much faster when `k << n`.

### 🧠 **Kth Largest Element**

LeetCode 215:

* Use Min Heap of size `k`
* After processing all elements, root of heap is the answer

---

### ⚙️ **Other Applications:**

* **Streaming Top K** (e.g., logs, scores)
* **Sliding Window Max/Min**
* **Frequency-based Top K** (use heap + hashmap)

---

### 🟢 **Why Heap?**

* Efficiently maintains the K best elements
* Insert/Delete in **O(log k)**
* Much faster than full sort for large `n`

Use a **Heap** when you need **partial ordering** — not full sort — to quickly find the top/least **K elements**.
