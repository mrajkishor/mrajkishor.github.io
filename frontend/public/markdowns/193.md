# **Understanding Write-Read Conflict (Dirty Read Problem) in DBMS**

In the world of databases, concurrency control is essential to ensure consistency and reliability when multiple transactions operate on shared data simultaneously. One of the common concurrency problems is the **Write-Read Conflict**, also known as the **Dirty Read Problem**. This blog will explore this problem in detail, its implications, and how it can be mitigated with proper concurrency control mechanisms.

## **What is a Dirty Read Problem?**

A **Dirty Read** occurs when one transaction (let's call it `T2`) reads data that has been modified by another transaction (`T1`) but has not yet been committed. If `T1` rolls back after `T2` has read the uncommitted data, `T2` will be working with invalid or inconsistent data, leading to potential data integrity issues.

---

### **Characteristics of Dirty Reads**
- **Uncommitted Dependency**: A transaction depends on uncommitted changes from another transaction.
- **Inconsistency**: The data read by one transaction can become invalid if the other transaction rolls back.
- **Violation of Isolation**: Dirty reads occur due to lack of proper isolation between transactions.

## **Example of a Dirty Read**

Let's illustrate the dirty read problem with an example.

### **Scenario**: Bank Account Balance Update
Consider a banking system where:
- **Transaction T1** updates the balance of Account A.
- **Transaction T2** reads the balance of Account A.

#### **Steps in Execution**
1. **Initial State**:  
   Account A Balance = $500.

2. **Transaction T1** begins and updates the balance:
   ```
   T1: BEGIN;
   T1: UPDATE Account_A SET Balance = $600; -- Balance updated but not committed.
   ```

3. **Transaction T2** reads the balance:
   ```
   T2: BEGIN;
   T2: SELECT Balance FROM Account_A; -- Reads $600 (uncommitted value).
   ```

4. **Transaction T1** rolls back:
   ```
   T1: ROLLBACK; -- Changes discarded, Balance = $500.
   ```

5. **Transaction T2** continues with the dirty read:
   ```
   T2: INSERT INTO Transactions (Account, Amount) VALUES (A, 600); -- Uses $600.
   ```

#### **Result**:
- `T2` uses a balance of $600, which was never valid, leading to **data inconsistency**.

## **Why is Dirty Read a Problem?**

Dirty reads can have severe implications:
1. **Data Inconsistency**: Transactions operate on invalid or outdated data.
2. **Integrity Violations**: If dirty data propagates to other dependent transactions or systems, it can compromise data integrity.
3. **Unpredictable Behavior**: The final state of the database can vary depending on the rollback or commit actions of other transactions.

---

## **How to Mitigate Dirty Reads?**

Dirty reads occur due to insufficient isolation levels in the database. To address this, we can use higher **Isolation Levels** as defined by the SQL standard.

### **Isolation Levels**
1. **Read Uncommitted** (Allows Dirty Reads):
   - Transactions can read uncommitted data.
   - Least restrictive but prone to dirty reads.

2. **Read Committed** (Prevents Dirty Reads):
   - Transactions can only read committed data.
   - Ensures that a transaction reads consistent data.

3. **Repeatable Read** (Prevents Non-Repeatable Reads):
   - Ensures the data read by a transaction remains consistent during its execution.

4. **Serializable** (Highest Isolation):
   - Ensures complete isolation between transactions.
   - Prevents all concurrency problems, including phantom reads.

## **Example of Preventing Dirty Reads**

Using the previous example, let’s see how a **Read Committed** isolation level can prevent dirty reads.

1. **Initial State**:  
   Account A Balance = $500.

2. **Transaction T1** begins and updates the balance:
   ```
   T1: BEGIN;
   T1: UPDATE Account_A SET Balance = $600; -- Balance updated but not committed.
   ```

3. **Transaction T2** tries to read the balance:
   ```
   T2: BEGIN;
   T2: SELECT Balance FROM Account_A; -- Waits until T1 commits or rolls back.
   ```

4. **Transaction T1** rolls back:
   ```
   T1: ROLLBACK; -- Balance reverts to $500.
   ```

5. **Transaction T2** now reads the correct balance:
   ```
   T2: SELECT Balance FROM Account_A; -- Reads $500 (committed value).
   ```

### **Result**:
- T2 reads only committed data, ensuring consistency.

## **How Databases Handle Dirty Reads**

Modern DBMSs implement **Concurrency Control Mechanisms** to address dirty reads and other concurrency issues:
1. **Locking**:
   - **Shared Locks** for read operations.
   - **Exclusive Locks** for write operations.

2. **Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)**:
   - Maintains multiple versions of data.
   - Transactions access the latest committed version.

3. **Transaction Isolation**:
   - Enforcing higher isolation levels like **Read Committed** or **Serializable**.

## **Practical Example in SQL**

Here’s how dirty reads can occur and be prevented in a SQL database:

### **Dirty Read with Read Uncommitted**
```sql
-- Transaction T1
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = 600 WHERE AccountID = 1;

-- Transaction T2
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts; -- Reads $600 (dirty read).

-- Transaction T1
ROLLBACK; -- Balance reverts to $500.
```

### **Preventing Dirty Read with Read Committed**
```sql
-- Transaction T1
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = 600 WHERE AccountID = 1;

-- Transaction T2
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts; -- Waits until T1 commits or rolls back.

-- Transaction T1
ROLLBACK; -- Balance reverts to $500.
```

## **Conclusion**

The **Write-Read Conflict (Dirty Read Problem)** is a common concurrency issue in DBMS that can lead to **data inconsistency** and compromise the reliability of the system. By enforcing proper **isolation levels** and employing **concurrency control techniques**, we can prevent dirty reads and ensure the database operates in a consistent and reliable manner.

Understanding and addressing dirty reads is critical for designing robust database systems, especially in scenarios involving high concurrency and critical data operations.
