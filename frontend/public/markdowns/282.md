# What is NestJS? A Comprehensive Guide  

## Introduction  
NestJS is a **progressive, TypeScript-based framework** for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. Built on **Node.js**, it takes inspiration from **Angular** and follows a modular architecture with built-in support for **dependency injection, decorators, and structured organization**.  

NestJS leverages **Express.js** or **Fastify** under the hood while providing additional abstractions and features, making it an excellent choice for **enterprise-grade applications**.

## Why Use NestJS?  

### 1. **TypeScript-First**  
NestJS is written in **TypeScript** by default, providing **strong typing, better tooling, and improved maintainability**.  

### 2. **Modular Architecture**  
NestJS applications are **highly modular**, meaning they are divided into **modules, controllers, and services**. This structure enhances maintainability and scalability.  

### 3. **Built-in Dependency Injection (DI)**  
Dependency Injection (DI) is at the core of NestJS, making it easier to manage and **inject dependencies across modules and services**.  

### 4. **Supports Multiple Transport Layers**  
NestJS natively supports **REST APIs, GraphQL, WebSockets, gRPC, and Microservices**. It is a versatile framework for different use cases.  

### 5. **Middleware, Guards, Interceptors, and Pipes**  
NestJS provides essential tools like **middleware for request handling**, **guards for authentication**, **interceptors for modifying responses**, and **pipes for validation and transformation**.  

### 6. **Fastify Support for Performance**  
By default, NestJS uses **Express**, but it can be switched to **Fastify** for better performance in high-throughput applications.

## Core Concepts of NestJS  

### 1. **Modules**  
Modules help organize the application. Every NestJS app has an `AppModule`, and additional modules can be created for better organization.  

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersModule } from './users/users.module';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### 2. **Controllers**  
Controllers handle incoming requests and define **routes** in NestJS.  

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  getAllUsers() {
    return 'Returning all users';
  }
}
```

### 3. **Providers (Services)**  
Services contain the business logic and are injected into controllers using **dependency injection**.  

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  getUsers() {
    return ['John Doe', 'Jane Doe'];
  }
}
```

### 4. **Dependency Injection**  
NestJS provides built-in DI to manage dependencies efficiently. Services can be injected into controllers as follows:  

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}

  @Get()
  getUsers() {
    return this.usersService.getUsers();
  }
}
```

### 5. **Middleware**  
Middleware in NestJS is similar to Express.js middleware and is used for logging, authentication, etc.  

```typescript
import { Injectable, NestMiddleware } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class LoggerMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  use(req: any, res: any, next: () => void) {
    console.log('Request received');
    next();
  }
}
```

## Features of NestJS  

### 1. **GraphQL Support**  
NestJS supports **GraphQL** with Apollo or Mercurius.  

### 2. **WebSockets for Real-Time Applications**  
NestJS provides built-in support for **WebSockets**, making it ideal for **real-time chat applications, live updates, and notifications**.  

### 3. **Microservices and Event-Driven Architecture**  
NestJS allows developers to build **scalable microservices** using Redis, Kafka, MQTT, and more.  

### 4. **Built-in Validation with Pipes**  
NestJS uses **class-validator** to validate incoming request data easily.  

```typescript
import { IsString, IsInt } from 'class-validator';

export class CreateUserDto {
  @IsString()
  name: string;

  @IsInt()
  age: number;
}
```

## Getting Started with NestJS  

### **Step 1: Install NestJS CLI**  
```sh
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

### **Step 2: Create a New NestJS Project**  
```sh
nest new my-app
```

### **Step 3: Run the Application**  
```sh
npm run start
```

### **Step 4: Open the API**  
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the default API running.
