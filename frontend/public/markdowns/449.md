# 📘 Predicates and Quantifiers – Explained with Examples

In **propositional logic**, we deal with simple true/false statements. But many real-world statements involve **variables** and are more complex than what propositional logic can handle. This is where **First Order Logic (FOL)** comes in — it introduces **predicates** and **quantifiers** to describe these statements more precisely.

## 🔹 What is a Predicate?

A **predicate** is a statement that contains **variables** and becomes a **proposition** only when the variables are replaced by specific values.

### 📌 Definition:
> A **predicate** is a function or rule `P(x)` that returns **true** or **false**, depending on the value of `x`.

### ✅ Example:
- "x is a prime number" → predicate: `Prime(x)`
- "x > 3" → predicate: `GreaterThanThree(x)`
- If `x = 5`, then `GreaterThanThree(5)` is **True**  
- If `x = 2`, then `GreaterThanThree(2)` is **False**

---

## 🔸 Domain of Discourse

The set of all possible values a variable can take is called the **domain** (or universe of discourse).

For example:
- Domain: all integers
- Predicate: `Even(x)`
- `Even(2)` is true; `Even(3)` is false

## 🔹 Quantifiers: ∀ and ∃

**Quantifiers** are used to express the **extent** to which a predicate holds over a domain.

---

### 1. **Universal Quantifier ( ∀ )**

📌 Symbol: `∀x P(x)`  
**Reads as**: “For all x, P(x) is true.”

✅ Means that the predicate holds **for every value** of x in the domain.

### ✅ Example:
> ∀x (x > 0) → "All x are greater than 0"  
- If domain = {1, 2, 3} → ✅ True  
- If domain = {–1, 0, 1} → ❌ False (because –1 and 0 are not > 0)

---

### 2. **Existential Quantifier ( ∃ )**

📌 Symbol: `∃x P(x)`  
**Reads as**: “There exists an x such that P(x) is true.”

✅ Means that **at least one** value of x in the domain satisfies the predicate.

### ✅ Example:
> ∃x (x < 0) → "There exists an x less than 0"  
- If domain = {–3, –2, –1} → ✅ True  
- If domain = {1, 2, 3} → ❌ False

---

## 🔄 Combining Quantifiers

Quantifiers can be combined to express complex logic.

### Example 1:  
**Statement**: Every student has submitted the assignment.  
→ ∀x (Student(x) → Submitted(x))

### Example 2:  
**Statement**: There exists a student who has not submitted.  
→ ∃x (Student(x) ∧ ¬Submitted(x))

## 🔁 Negating Quantifiers

Quantifier negation follows these rules:

| Original Statement     | Negation                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| ∀x P(x)                | ∃x ¬P(x)                     |
| ∃x P(x)                | ∀x ¬P(x)                     |

📌 Example:  
- ¬(∀x Passed(x)) = ∃x ¬Passed(x) → "Not everyone passed" means "Someone failed"

## 🎯 Use Cases in Computer Science

- **Database queries** (e.g., “Find all users who bought item X”)
- **Formal verification** and **program specifications**
- **Artificial intelligence**, **knowledge representation**, and **logic programming**
- Writing **loop invariants** and **assertions** in software

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Concept              | Symbol     | Meaning                            |
|----------------------|------------|------------------------------------|
| Predicate            | P(x)       | Statement involving a variable     |
| Universal Quantifier | ∀x P(x)    | P(x) is true for **all** x         |
| Existential Quantifier | ∃x P(x) | P(x) is true for **some** x        |
| Negation of ∀x P(x)  | ∃x ¬P(x)   | At least one x where P(x) is false |
| Negation of ∃x P(x)  | ∀x ¬P(x)   | P(x) is false for all x            |

## ✅ Final Thought

**Predicates and quantifiers** make logic expressive enough to model real-world rules, relationships, and reasoning in a formal and precise way — forming the foundation for **computer science, AI, mathematics, and logic-based programming**.
