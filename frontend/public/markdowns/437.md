## 📘 Propositions and Logical Connectives

### 🔹 What is a Proposition?
A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is **either true or false**, but not both.  
Examples:  
- "The Earth is round." → ✅ Proposition  
- "Close the door!" → ❌ Not a proposition (it's a command)

### 🔹 Types of Propositions:
1. **Atomic (Simple) Proposition**: Cannot be broken down further.
   - Example: “It is raining.”
2. **Compound Proposition**: Formed by combining simpler propositions using logical connectives.
   - Example: “It is raining and it is cold.”

## 🔹 Logical Connectives (Operators)

### 1. **Negation (¬ or NOT)**  
- Symbol: `¬P` or `~P`  
- Meaning: “Not P” — the opposite truth value of P.  
- Truth Table:

| P | ¬P |
|---|----|
| T | F  |
| F | T  |

---

### 2. **Conjunction (∧ or AND)**  
- Symbol: `P ∧ Q`  
- True only if both P and Q are true.  
- Truth Table:

| P | Q | P ∧ Q |
|---|---|--------|
| T | T |   T    |
| T | F |   F    |
| F | T |   F    |
| F | F |   F    |

---

### 3. **Disjunction (∨ or OR)**  
- Symbol: `P ∨ Q`  
- True if **at least one** of P or Q is true.  
- Truth Table:

| P | Q | P ∨ Q |
|---|---|--------|
| T | T |   T    |
| T | F |   T    |
| F | T |   T    |
| F | F |   F    |

---

### 4. **Exclusive OR (⊕ or XOR)**  
- Symbol: `P ⊕ Q`  
- True **only when exactly one** of P or Q is true.  
- Truth Table:

| P | Q | P ⊕ Q |
|---|---|--------|
| T | T |   F    |
| T | F |   T    |
| F | T |   T    |
| F | F |   F    |

---

### 5. **Implication (→ or IF...THEN)**  
- Symbol: `P → Q`  
- Meaning: “If P is true, then Q must also be true.”  
- False only when P is true and Q is false.  
- Truth Table:

| P | Q | P → Q |
|---|---|--------|
| T | T |   T    |
| T | F |   F    |
| F | T |   T    |
| F | F |   T    |

---

### 6. **Biconditional (↔ or IFF)**  
- Symbol: `P ↔ Q`  
- Meaning: “P if and only if Q” — ==both have the same truth value==.  
- Truth Table:

| P | Q | P ↔ Q |
|---|---|--------|
| T | T |   T    |
| T | F |   F    |
| F | T |   F    |
| F | F |   T    |

## 🔹 Precedence of Logical Connectives
From highest to lowest:
```
1. ¬ (NOT)
2. ∧ (AND)
3. ∨ (OR)
4. → (IMPLIES)
5. ↔ (BICONDITIONAL)
```

---

**Simple and clear example to demonstrate **operator precedence** in propositional logic:**



### 🧪 Expression:
```
¬P ∨ Q ∧ R
```

### 🧠 Operator Precedence (from highest to lowest):
1. **¬** (NOT)
2. **∧** (AND)
3. **∨** (OR)

---

### 🔍 Step-by-step Evaluation:
Expression:  
```
¬P ∨ Q ∧ R
```

According to precedence:
- First evaluate **¬P**
- Then **Q ∧ R**
- Finally **¬P ∨ (Q ∧ R)**

So, the expression is equivalent to:
```
(¬P) ∨ (Q ∧ R)
```

---

### ✅ Example with Values:
Let `P = T`, `Q = F`, `R = T`

Evaluate:
- `¬P = F`
- `Q ∧ R = F ∧ T = F`
- `¬P ∨ (Q ∧ R) = F ∨ F = F`
