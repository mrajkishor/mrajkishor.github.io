### 📌 **Introduction to Cryptographic Hash Functions**

Cryptographic hash functions are fundamental components in information security and are widely used in digital signatures, message integrity checks, and password hashing. A **hash function** takes an input (also called a *message*) and returns a **fixed-size string of bytes**, typically appearing random. This output is known as the **hash value** or **digest**.

#### 🔑 Key Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions:

1. **Deterministic Output**
   The same input will always produce the same hash value, no matter how many times it is processed.

2. **Quick Computation**
   The hash of any input can be computed efficiently, making it suitable for real-time applications.

3. **Pre-image Resistance** *(Infeasibility of Inversion)*
   It is computationally infeasible to determine the original input given its hash value. This ensures confidentiality.

4. **Avalanche Effect** *(Small Changes Lead to Drastic Changes)*
   A tiny change in the input (even one bit) results in a completely different output, making it impossible to predict the hash structure.

5. **Collision Resistance**
   It should be practically impossible to find two different inputs that generate the same hash value, thereby preventing forgery or tampering.

### 📌 **Message Digest Algorithms**

Message Digest Algorithms are types of cryptographic hash functions used mainly for **data integrity**. They create a digest (a small, fixed-size hash) from input data, ensuring that any alteration in data is detectable.

#### 🔍 **MD5 (Message Digest 5)**

* **Output Size**: 128-bit (16-byte) hash.
* **Purpose**: Initially used for integrity checks and digital signatures.
* **Usage**: Common in early internet protocols, file verification, and password hashing.

##### ❌ **Weaknesses of MD5**:

* **Collision Attacks**: Researchers demonstrated that two different inputs could produce the same hash value, violating collision resistance.
* **Not Secure**: Because of its vulnerabilities, MD5 is now considered **obsolete** and **unsuitable for modern cryptographic use**, particularly in digital signatures and certificates.

### ✅ **Conclusion**

Cryptographic hash functions ensure data integrity and security, but their strength depends on their resistance to attacks. While MD5 was once widely adopted, it has been replaced by more secure algorithms like SHA-256 and SHA-3 due to its susceptibility to collision attacks.
