# Understanding Bellman-Ford Algorithm for Shortest Path

The Bellman-Ford Algorithm is a fundamental graph algorithm that computes the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. Unlike Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford can handle graphs with negative weight edges, making it more versatile for certain applications.

In this blog, we will explore the Bellman-Ford Algorithm in depth, its implementation, different approaches, and analyze its time and space complexity.

## Key Features of Bellman-Ford Algorithm

1. **Handles Negative Weights**: Bellman-Ford can detect negative weight cycles and compute shortest paths in graphs with negative edge weights.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: It progressively relaxes edges to find the shortest path.
3. **Shortest Path Guarantee**: Works on directed and undirected graphs with no negative weight cycles.

### Applications:
- Detecting negative weight cycles.
- Routing protocols in computer networks.
- Financial arbitrage in currency exchange graphs.

## How Bellman-Ford Algorithm Works

### Steps:
1. **Initialize Distances**:
   - Assign a distance of 0 to the source node.
   - Assign a distance of infinity (`∞`) to all other nodes.

2. **Relax Edges**:
   - For each edge `(u, v)` with weight `w`, update `distance[v]` as `distance[u] + w` if this results in a smaller value.
   - Repeat this for all edges `V - 1` times, where `V` is the number of vertices.

3. **Detect Negative Weight Cycles**:
   - After `V - 1` iterations, check all edges for further relaxation. If a shorter path is found, a negative weight cycle exists.

### Example Graph:
```
   A --4--> B
   |       /
   2     -1
   |    /
   v   v
   C <--3
```

**Source Node**: A

**Edge Weights**:
- A to B: 4
- A to C: 2
- B to C: -1
- C to B: 3

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm Implementation in Java

### Graph Representation
We use an edge list representation for the graph.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Graph {
    class Edge {
        int source, destination, weight;

        Edge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
            this.source = source;
            this.destination = destination;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }

    private final List<Edge> edges;
    private final int vertices;

    public Graph(int vertices) {
        this.vertices = vertices;
        this.edges = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addEdge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
        edges.add(new Edge(source, destination, weight));
    }

    public List<Edge> getEdges() {
        return edges;
    }

    public int getVertices() {
        return vertices;
    }
}
```

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm

#### Implementation
```java
public class BellmanFord {

    public void findShortestPaths(Graph graph, int source) {
        int vertices = graph.getVertices();
        int[] distance = new int[vertices];

        // Step 1: Initialize distances
        Arrays.fill(distance, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        distance[source] = 0;

        // Step 2: Relax edges V - 1 times
        for (int i = 1; i < vertices; i++) {
            for (Graph.Edge edge : graph.getEdges()) {
                int u = edge.source;
                int v = edge.destination;
                int weight = edge.weight;
                if (distance[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && distance[u] + weight < distance[v]) {
                    distance[v] = distance[u] + weight;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Check for negative weight cycles
        for (Graph.Edge edge : graph.getEdges()) {
            int u = edge.source;
            int v = edge.destination;
            int weight = edge.weight;
            if (distance[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && distance[u] + weight < distance[v]) {
                System.out.println("Graph contains a negative weight cycle.");
                return;
            }
        }

        // Print distances
        printDistances(distance);
    }

    private void printDistances(int[] distance) {
        System.out.println("Vertex Distance from Source");
        for (int i = 0; i < distance.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(i + "\t" + (distance[i] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "∞" : distance[i]));
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Graph graph = new Graph(5);
        graph.addEdge(0, 1, 6);
        graph.addEdge(0, 2, 7);
        graph.addEdge(1, 2, 8);
        graph.addEdge(1, 3, 5);
        graph.addEdge(1, 4, -4);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3, -3);
        graph.addEdge(2, 4, 9);
        graph.addEdge(3, 1, -2);
        graph.addEdge(4, 0, 2);
        graph.addEdge(4, 3, 7);

        BellmanFord bellmanFord = new BellmanFord();
        bellmanFord.findShortestPaths(graph, 0);
    }
}
```
