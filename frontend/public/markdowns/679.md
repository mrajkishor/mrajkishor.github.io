# 🛡️ **Cryptography Fundamentals, Cryptanalysis & Steganography**

Cryptography plays a vital role in **information security** by protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data, especially during transmission over insecure channels.

## 🔐 **1. Cryptography Fundamentals**

### 🔸 What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, so that only authorized parties can access it. It ensures:

* **Confidentiality** – Only intended recipients can understand the message.
* **Integrity** – Data is not altered during transmission.
* **Authentication** – Verifying the source of the message.

## 🏛️ **2. Classical Cryptographic Methods**

These were used before computers but are fundamental in understanding modern cryptography.

### 📌 a. Substitution Ciphers

Replaces each element (letter/character) of the plaintext with another according to a rule.

#### 1. **Caesar Cipher**

* Each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
* Example (shift = 3): A → D, B → E, Z → C.
* Easy to break via brute-force or frequency analysis.

#### 2. **Monoalphabetic Cipher**

* Each letter is replaced by a unique, fixed letter in the ciphertext.
* Vulnerable to **frequency analysis** (e.g., 'E' being most common in English).

#### 3. **Polyalphabetic Cipher (e.g., Vigenère Cipher)**

* Uses multiple cipher alphabets based on a **keyword**.
* Provides better security than monoalphabetic.
* Can be cracked using **Kasiski examination** or **repeated-key frequency patterns**.

### 📌 b. Transposition Ciphers

Rather than replacing letters, these rearrange the positions of characters in plaintext.

#### 1. **Rail Fence Cipher**

* Letters are written in a zigzag pattern (like fence rails) across multiple lines and read row-wise.
* Example: “HELLO WORLD” → “HOLELWRLOD” (if 3 rails).

#### 2. **Columnar Transposition**

* Plaintext is written row-wise under a keyword and read column-wise in the order of letters in the keyword.
* Increases difficulty for attackers as it scrambles letter positions.

## 🔑 **3. Importance of Classical Methods**

* They introduce core concepts: encryption, decryption, key usage, and security through obscurity.
* Modern algorithms build upon these principles with advanced math and computation.

## 🔍 **4. Introduction to Cryptanalysis**

Cryptanalysis is the science of breaking ciphers and decoding messages without knowing the key.

### Common Cryptanalysis Techniques:

#### 🔹 Frequency Analysis

* Used against substitution ciphers.
* Exploits the predictable frequency of letters in a language.

#### 🔹 Brute Force Attack

* Tries all possible key combinations until the correct one is found.
* Effective against simple or short-key ciphers.

#### 🔹 Differential Cryptanalysis

* Studies how input changes affect the output in block ciphers.
* Useful against symmetric-key ciphers.

#### 🔹 Linear Cryptanalysis

* Uses linear equations to approximate the behavior of the cipher.
* Helps deduce key bits through statistical analysis.

## 🕵️‍♂️ **5. Steganography**

### What is Steganography?

Steganography hides the **existence** of a message rather than its content, as in cryptography.

### 🔹 Historical Example

* Greeks used wooden tablets covered with wax and wrote hidden messages underneath.

### 🔹 Digital Steganography

* Hides data within digital media (images, audio, video).
* Uses techniques like **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** modification in images.
* Advantage: the message is invisible to the human eye.

### 🔹 Applications

* Covert communication
* Digital watermarking for copyright protection
* Malware hiding

## ⚖️ **6. Cryptography vs Steganography: A Comparison**

| Aspect             | **Cryptography**                                           | **Steganography**                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**        | Encrypts content to make it unreadable                     | Hides the existence of the message                |
| **Visibility**     | Message is visible but unreadable                          | Message is hidden within another medium           |
| **Technique**      | Uses encryption algorithms (e.g., substitution, AES, etc.) | Uses carrier files (images, audio) to embed data  |
| **Key Usage**      | Requires a key for encryption and decryption               | May or may not require a key                      |
| **Security Focus** | Secures the **content** of the message                     | Secures the **presence** of the message           |
| **Detection**      | Can be detected if encryption is suspected                 | Often undetected if well-implemented              |
| **Application**    | Used in banking, secure comms, etc.                        | Used in watermarking, covert messaging, espionage |
| **Combination**    | Can be combined with steganography                         | Can hide encrypted messages for extra security    |

## 🔒 **7. Combined Use: Cryptography + Steganography**

* For advanced security, data can be **encrypted** using cryptography and then **hidden** using steganography.
* Example: Encrypt a message with Vigenère cipher → Embed in an image via LSB → Send the image.

---

## ✅ **Conclusion**

* Classical methods (substitution & transposition) form the backbone of cryptographic evolution.
* Cryptanalysis teaches how to test the strength of cryptosystems.
* Steganography adds a layer of secrecy by concealing the existence of data.
* Combining both ensures stronger data protection in today’s cyber landscape.
