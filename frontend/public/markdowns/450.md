# 📘 Free and Bound Variables – Explained with Clarity

When working with **First Order Logic (FOL)**, we often write expressions with **variables**. But **not all variables are equal** in their scope — some are **bound** by quantifiers, and others are **free** to vary.

Understanding the difference between **free** and **bound** variables is essential in logic, programming languages, and formal mathematics.

## 🔹 What is a Variable in Logic?

In predicate logic, variables like `x`, `y`, and `z` are used to represent **elements from a domain** (like all people, integers, etc.).

These variables can appear inside predicates such as `P(x)` or `Loves(x, y)`.

But how a variable is interpreted depends on whether it is **free** or **bound**.

## 🔒 Bound Variables

A **bound variable** is one that is **quantified** — i.e., it is controlled by a quantifier like:

- Universal quantifier (∀) – “for all”
- Existential quantifier (∃) – “there exists”

### ✅ Example:
```text
∀x (P(x))
```
Here, `x` is a **bound variable** because it's under the scope of the **∀x** quantifier.

📌 Bound variables are **placeholders** — they don’t refer to any specific value until the quantifier operates over a domain.

---

## 🔓 Free Variables

A **free variable** is **not bound** by any quantifier and is **not restricted in scope**. It’s treated as a symbolic placeholder — often meaning the formula depends on it.

### ✅ Example:
```text
P(x)
```
Here, `x` is a **free variable** because there's no quantifier like `∀x` or `∃x` to bind it.

📌 Free variables can be seen as **external inputs** to a formula.

## 🔁 Mixed Example: Both Free and Bound

```text
∃y (P(x, y))
```

- `y` is **bound** (quantified by ∃)  
- `x` is **free** (not quantified)

➡️ The formula depends on the value of `x`, while `y` varies within the quantifier's scope.

## 🔍 Identifying Free and Bound Variables (Step-by-step)

Given:
```text
∀x (P(x) ∧ ∃y Q(x, y)) ∧ R(y)
```

Analyze:

| Variable | Status   | Why                                      |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| x        | Bound    | Under the scope of ∀x                     |
| y (in Q) | Bound    | Bound by ∃y inside Q                     |
| y (in R) | Free     | Outside ∃y, not in scope — remains free |

## 🧠 Why Does It Matter?

1. **Free variables make a formula open** — it needs input to evaluate.
2. **Bound variables close a formula** — it becomes a proposition with a truth value.
3. Important in:
   - Predicate logic
   - Function definitions in programming
   - Scope analysis in compilers
   - Quantified logic in AI and mathematics

## 🔐 Closed vs Open Formulas

| Type        | Description                          | Example                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Closed**  | No free variables (all are bound)    | ∀x ∃y (Loves(x, y))     |
| **Open**    | Has at least one free variable       | Loves(x, y)             |

## 🧾 Summary

| Term             | Meaning                                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Free Variable**  | Not inside any quantifier                      |
| **Bound Variable** | Controlled by ∀ or ∃ quantifier                |
| **Open Formula**   | Contains free variables                        |
| **Closed Formula** | All variables are bound — evaluates to true/false |

---

## ✅ Final Thought

> **Bound variables** are like **function parameters** inside a function — they are used and discarded.  
> **Free variables** are like **global variables or inputs** — they make the formula depend on external context.

Understanding **free and bound variables** is fundamental for mastering logic, especially in **predicate calculus, compilers, and AI systems**.
