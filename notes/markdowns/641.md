### ðŸ“˜ Redis Sets â€“ Set Operations (Union, Intersection)

Redis supports native **set-theoretic operations** that are useful in comparing and combining sets of data. Two of the most common operations are **Union** and **Intersection**, which are efficient and can be performed across multiple sets in **constant or linear time** depending on the size of the input sets.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. `SUNION` â€“ Set Union

### âœ… Purpose:
`SUNION` returns a **new set containing all unique elements** from one or more input sets. It effectively combines all elements across the specified sets, eliminating duplicates.

### ðŸ”§ Syntax:
```bash
SUNION key1 key2 ... keyN
```

### ðŸ§ª Example:
```bash
SADD set1 "a" "b" "c"
SADD set2 "b" "c" "d"

SUNION set1 set2
# â†’ ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```

### ðŸŸ¢ Use Cases:
- Combining all tags used in multiple articles.
- Merging user interests from different sources.
- Finding all participants from multiple event lists.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. `SINTER` â€“ Set Intersection

### âœ… Purpose:
`SINTER` returns a **new set containing elements common to all** specified sets.

### ðŸ”§ Syntax:
```bash
SINTER key1 key2 ... keyN
```

### ðŸ§ª Example:
```bash
SADD set1 "a" "b" "c"
SADD set2 "b" "c" "d"

SINTER set1 set2
# â†’ ["b", "c"]
```

### ðŸŸ¢ Use Cases:
- Finding users subscribed to multiple newsletters.
- Identifying friends in common between two users.
- Products tagged under multiple common categories.

## ðŸ”¹ Performance Notes

| Operation | Time Complexity   |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `SUNION`  | O(N) (sum of all elements in sets) |
| `SINTER`  | O(N*M) (N = elements in smallest set, M = number of sets) |

Redis optimizes these operations by scanning the **smallest set first** during intersection to minimize cost.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary Table

| Command    | Description                                | Output Example             |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `SUNION`   | Union of all unique elements in sets       | `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`     |
| `SINTER`   | Intersection of common elements in sets    | `["b", "c"]`               |

### âœ… Final Thoughts

Set operations like `SUNION` and `SINTER` make Redis an excellent tool for **real-time analytics**, **user segmentation**, **recommendation systems**, and **social graph analysis**. These operations are extremely fast, memory-efficient, and well-suited for building complex logic with minimal overhead.
