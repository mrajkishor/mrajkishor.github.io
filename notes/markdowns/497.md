# ⚙️ Installing Next.js – The Complete Beginner’s Guide


## 🧭 Introduction

**Next.js** is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build **production-grade** web applications with features like **server-side rendering**, **static site generation**, **image optimization**, and **API routes** – all out of the box.

Before you dive into building with Next.js, you need to set up your environment properly. This post covers **step-by-step instructions** to install and run your first Next.js app.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before installing Next.js, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js** installed (version **16.8** or later recommended)
2. A **code editor** like **VS Code**
3. Basic knowledge of **JavaScript** and **React**

You can check your Node version:

```bash
node -v
```

If not installed, download it from: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

## 📦 Step 1: Create a New Next.js App

The fastest and recommended way to install Next.js is using the official command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn create next-app my-next-app
```

Or with PNPM:

```bash
pnpm create next-app my-next-app
```

### What it does:
- Sets up a new folder `my-next-app`
- Installs all dependencies
- Configures ESLint, TypeScript (optional), and Tailwind (optional)
- Generates a minimal boilerplate structure

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Step 2: Interactive Setup Options

When you run the `create-next-app` command, you’ll be asked:

```bash
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? › No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? › Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? › No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use src/ directory? › No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use experimental app directory? › Yes / No
```

> ✅ Choose based on your preference. For beginners, the defaults are fine.

## 📂 Step 3: Project Structure Overview

After setup, your folder will look like:

```
my-next-app/
├── pages/             # Route-based components (index.js = home)
├── public/            # Static assets like images, favicon
├── styles/            # Global or module-based CSS
├── next.config.js     # Next.js configuration
├── package.json       # Project metadata and scripts
└── node_modules/      # Installed dependencies
```

If you chose the `app/` directory (App Router):

```
my-next-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.js
│   ├── page.js
```

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Start the Development Server

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

This starts your Next.js app at:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see a welcome screen: **“Welcome to Next.js!”**

---

## 🛠️ Step 5: Modify Your First Page

Open `pages/index.js` (or `app/page.js`) and change the text to see **hot reload** in action:

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js 👋</h1>
}
```

Save the file, and your browser will instantly update!

## 🧪 Bonus: Useful Scripts

Next.js provides these default scripts in `package.json`:

| Command           | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`     | Start development server (hot reload)|
| `npm run build`   | Create production build              |
| `npm run start`   | Start production server              |
| `npm run lint`    | Run ESLint checks                    |

## 🌐 Optional: Deploy to Vercel

To deploy your app for free, use:

```bash
npx vercel
```

Or sign in at [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and connect your GitHub repo.

✅ Vercel offers one-click deployment for Next.js with edge support, analytics, and preview environments.
