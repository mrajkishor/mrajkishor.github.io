## ‚úÖ **5.1 Channel Allocation**

**Channel allocation** is the process of assigning communication channels (like frequency bands or time slots) to devices or users in a network to enable efficient and interference-free data transfer.

### üéØ **Objective:**

* Prevent interference or signal collision.
* Maximize channel utilization.
* Ensure fair and efficient communication.

| Method   | Full Form                          | How It Works                                                          | Use Case                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **FDMA** | Frequency Division Multiple Access | Each user gets a unique frequency band                                | Analog systems, radio              |
| **TDMA** | Time Division Multiple Access      | Each user gets a unique time slot on the same frequency               | Cellular networks (2G)             |
| **CDMA** | Code Division Multiple Access      | All users use the same frequency simultaneously but with unique codes | 3G mobile communication            |
| **SDMA** | Space Division Multiple Access     | Channels are separated by physical space (e.g., directional antennas) | Satellite & cellular base stations |
