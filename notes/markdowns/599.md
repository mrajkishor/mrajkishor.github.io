# 👥 **Two Pointers Technique**

*→ Efficient for traversing arrays from both ends or maintaining dynamic windows*

---

## 🧠 What is the Two Pointers Technique?

Two pointers is a powerful algorithmic pattern where **two indices** (pointers) are used to traverse data — usually:

* from **left and right ends**, or
* one **fast** and one **slow**, or
* to maintain a **window**

It allows you to solve many problems in **linear time** without brute force.

## 🎯 When to Use It

Use two pointers when:

* The array is **sorted** (or partially sorted)
* You're asked to find **pairs**, **triplets**, or **subarrays**
* You're trying to **reverse**, **partition**, or **compare two ends**
* You need to maintain a **sliding window** over a sequence

## 🛠️ Common Two Pointers Patterns

| Pattern                  | Description                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Opposite ends**        | One pointer from start, one from end          |
| **Fast and slow**        | Detect cycles, midpoints, etc.                |
| **Same direction**       | Expanding/shrinking a window (`start`, `end`) |
| **Two array comparison** | Compare elements in two sorted arrays         |

## 📘 Classic Two Pointers Examples

### 1️⃣ Pair Sum in Sorted Array

```java
int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (sum == target) return true;
    else if (sum < target) left++;
    else right--;
}
```

### 2️⃣ Reverse an Array

```java
int i = 0, j = nums.length - 1;
while (i < j) {
    int temp = nums[i];
    nums[i++] = nums[j];
    nums[j--] = temp;
}
```

### 3️⃣ Remove Duplicates (in-place) | Note: This array is sorted and duplicates can be any number

```java
int slow = 1;
for (int fast = 1; fast < nums.length; fast++) {
    if (nums[fast] != nums[fast - 1]) {
        nums[slow++] = nums[fast];
    }
}
```

Here, 
Input :  1, 1, 2, 2, 3
Output : 1, 2, 3, 2, 3

Note: So the last two values (2, 3) are leftovers from the original array — not cleared or set to null, _, or 0.

✅ Why LeetCode doesn’t care:
Because the return value is slow, and you're supposed to only consider nums[0..slow-1].

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Forgetting to update one or both pointers → causes infinite loop
* Not checking boundaries: `left < right` or `right >= 0`
* Using two pointers on **unsorted data** when sorting is required
* Confusing with prefix sum when a sliding window is better
