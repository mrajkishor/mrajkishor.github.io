## 📁  **File Structures (Heap, Sorted, Hashed)**

---

File organization is the way data is **physically stored on disk** in database systems. It plays a major role in:

* Read/write performance
* Indexing efficiency
* Query optimization
* Cost-based query planning (important in RDBMS internals)

---

## 🧱 1️⃣ **Heap File Organization (Unordered Files)**

> Records are stored in **no particular order**, simply **appended to the end** of the file.

### 🔹 Characteristics:

* Easy and fast to **insert new records**
* Searching requires **scanning all blocks** (linear scan)
* Deletion: simple, often replaced with a tombstone or blank slot

---

### 🧠 GATE-Level Points:

| Operation     | Time                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Insertion** | ✅ Fast (append at end)    |
| **Search**    | ❌ Slow (`O(n)`)           |
| **Deletion**  | Simple but may leave gaps |

### 📘 Use When:

* Bulk inserts are frequent
* No strict need for fast retrieval
* e.g., **Log files**, **audit tables**

---

## 📂 2️⃣ **Sorted File Organization (Sequential Files)**

> Records are stored **in sorted order** based on a **search key**.

### 🔹 Characteristics:

* Allows **binary search** on disk
* Insertion and deletion are **costly** (shifting records)
* ==Good for **range queries**==

---

### 🧠 GATE-Level Points:

| Operation         | Time                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Search**        | Fast (`O(log n)` disk seeks via binary search) |
| **Range Search**  | ✅ Very efficient                               |
| **Insert/Delete** | ❌ Expensive (shifting and maintaining order)   |

### 📘 Use When:

* Data is mostly **read-only**
* **Range queries** are common (e.g., "Get employees between ID 1000 to 2000")

---

## 🗃️ 3️⃣ **Hashed File Organization (Hash-Based Files)**

> Records are stored based on a **hash function** of the search key.

### 🔹 Characteristics:

* Fast direct access using `h(key)`
* **No order** among records
* Range queries are inefficient
* Collisions handled using **chaining or overflow blocks**

---

### 🧠 GATE-Level Points:

| Operation         | Time                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Search**        | `O(1)` expected (ideal case) |
| **Insert/Delete** | Fast (`O(1)` amortized)      |
| **Range Queries** | ❌ Not supported efficiently  |

---

### 📌 Hashing Variants:

| Type                | Feature                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static Hashing**  | Fixed number of buckets                               |
| **Dynamic Hashing** | Bucket count grows/shrinks (e.g., Extendible Hashing) |
| **Linear Hashing**  | Buckets split incrementally (good for large DBs)      |

## 🧮 Comparative Table

| Feature            | Heap          | Sorted            | Hashed            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Storage Order**  | Unordered     | Ordered (key)     | Based on hash     |
| **Insertion**      | Very Fast     | Slow (shifting)   | Fast              |
| **Search (point)** | Slow (`O(n)`) | Fast (`O(log n)`) | Fast (`O(1)`)     |
| **Range Search**   | ❌ Inefficient | ✅ Efficient       | ❌ Not Supported   |
| **Deletion**       | Simple        | Expensive         | Easy              |
| **Best Use Case**  | Logs, audit   | Range queries     | Lookup tables     |
| **Index Friendly** | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes             | ✅ with hash index |

## 🧠 GATE PYQ Focus Areas

* Identify **file type** based on access pattern
* Analyze **I/O cost** for operations (especially select queries)
* Compare **range vs point query performance**
* Dynamic vs static hashing questions

---

## 🧠 Example Questions (GATE Pattern)

**Q:** Which file structure is optimal for retrieving a record using a unique key when range queries are *not* required?

* A) Heap
* B) Sorted
* C) Hashed
* D) B-Tree

✅ **Answer: C – Hashed**

## 🔚 Summary

| File Type  | Best For                | Worst For           |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Heap**   | Inserts, no key queries | Search-heavy tables |
| **Sorted** | Range-based lookups     | Frequent updates    |
| **Hashed** | Fast key-based access   | Range queries       |
