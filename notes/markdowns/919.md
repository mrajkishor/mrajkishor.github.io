## 🕹️ Working With the DOM

## 🚀 What Are Uncontrolled Components?

In React, an **uncontrolled component** is a form input whose value is managed **by the DOM itself**, not by React state.

That means:

* You don't use `useState` to track input
* You access values using **refs** (`useRef`)
* The component is more like how forms work in plain HTML/JS

---

### 🧪 Example: Uncontrolled Input

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

function LoginForm() {
  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    const email = inputRef.current?.value;
    console.log("Submitted:", email);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input type="email" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

> The input is not "controlled" by React — you read its value directly when needed.

## 📦 Controlled vs Uncontrolled (Quick View)

| Feature                 | Controlled                            | Uncontrolled                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Data source             | React state (`useState`, Redux, etc.) | DOM node (`ref.current.value`) |
| Setup                   | `value` + `onChange`                  | `defaultValue` + `ref`         |
| React aware of changes? | ✅ Yes                                 | ❌ No                           |
| Suited for              | Large apps, real-time validation      | Simple forms, 3rd-party libs   |

## ✅ When to Use Uncontrolled Components (Even at Enterprise Scale)

| Use Case                             | Why Uncontrolled Makes Sense                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **File uploads**                     | File inputs are read via `ref.files`                 |
| **Focus control**                    | DOM focus/blur are easier with direct element access |
| **Integrating 3rd-party forms**      | Some libraries want access to raw DOM inputs         |
| **Performance-sensitive forms**      | Avoids re-rendering on every keystroke               |
| **Forms with minimal interactivity** | Static inputs, no real-time validation needed        |

## 🔧 File Upload Example (Can't Be Controlled!)

```tsx
function UploadForm() {
  const fileRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  const handleUpload = () => {
    const file = fileRef.current?.files?.[0];
    console.log("Selected:", file?.name);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input type="file" ref={fileRef} />
      <button onClick={handleUpload}>Upload</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

> `type="file"` cannot be made controlled in React — it must be uncontrolled.

## ⚠️ Drawbacks (Why They're Rarely Used in Complex Apps)

| Limitation                       | Why It’s a Problem in Large Apps                      |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Harder to validate live        | No `onChange` means no real-time validation           |
| ❌ No easy error UI               | You must inspect `.value` manually                    |
| ❌ Can’t easily debounce/throttle | Needs extra `ref` logic or listeners                  |
| ❌ Hard to sync with Redux/state  | Values live in the DOM — not in your app logic        |
| ❌ Breaks test predictability     | Difficult to unit test without mounting full DOM tree |

---

## 🧠 Enterprise Insight: Why Controlled Components Are Preferred

At companies like Google, Amazon, Meta:

* Forms are complex: multi-step, dynamic validation, conditional logic
* Input state is often tied to business logic and Redux/Saga state
* Uncontrolled components break testability, readability, and flow tracking

So **controlled inputs are the default**
…but uncontrolled is still valid for **niche, performance-sensitive, or external-integration** use cases.

## 🛠️ Hybrid Pattern: Controlled + Ref (Best of Both)

Sometimes, you want to control the value but still use a `ref`:

```tsx
const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

return (
  <input
    ref={inputRef}
    value={search}
    onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.target.value)}
  />
);
```

> This is great when you need controlled behavior **and** want to manipulate the DOM (e.g., focus, blur, reset).

## ✅ Summary

| Trait                  | Uncontrolled Component                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Value is stored in     | DOM element (`ref.current.value`)        |
| React knows the state? | ❌ No                                     |
| Re-render on change?   | ❌ No                                     |
| Use cases              | File inputs, external libs, simple forms |
| Preferred in Enterprise?    | ⚠️ Only in edge-cases                    |
| Testing difficulty     | ❌ More complex                           |

## 🧠 Real-World Tips

* ✅ Use `useRef()` for raw DOM access — don’t mutate it unless necessary
* ✅ Ideal for `file`, `focus`, `scroll`, `select`, `checkbox` hacks
* ❌ Don’t build a login or dynamic form fully uncontrolled — it will become messy quickly
* 🔄 Consider `React Hook Form` if you want a performance-first solution that abstracts both models
