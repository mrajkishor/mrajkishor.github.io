### üìò **Various Stages of the Pipeline in RISC Architecture**

---

Modern **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)** processors utilize a **five-stage pipeline** to improve instruction throughput by overlapping the execution phases of multiple instructions. Each stage in the pipeline performs a distinct operation, enabling the simultaneous execution of several instructions at different stages.

---

### üîÅ **The 5 Stages of the RISC Pipeline**

---

#### **1. Instruction Fetch (IF)**

* **Purpose**: To fetch the instruction from instruction memory.
* **Operation**:

  * The current **Program Counter (PC)** is used to read the instruction from **I-Memory**.
  * The **Next Program Counter (NPC)** is calculated as `PC + 4` (assuming fixed-length 4-byte instructions).
  * The instruction is stored in a **pipeline register (PR)** to pass to the next stage.

‚úÖ **Outcome**: Instruction loaded into pipeline for decoding.

---

#### **2. Instruction Decode / Register Fetch (ID)**

* **Purpose**: To decode the instruction and read source operands.
* **Operation**:

  * Instruction bits are decoded to generate **control signals**.
  * **Source operands** are fetched from the **register file**.
  * **Register specifiers** determine which operands to read.
  * Control signals, operands, and NPC are passed to the next stage via pipeline registers.

‚úÖ **Outcome**: Instruction is understood and ready for execution.

---

#### **3. Execute (EX)**

* **Purpose**: To perform arithmetic or logic operations.
* **Operation**:

  * Uses **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** to compute results.
  * Input operands can come from two registers or a register and an **immediate value**.
  * May also compute effective memory addresses for load/store instructions.

‚úÖ **Outcome**: ALU result or calculated memory address is generated.

---

#### **4. Memory Access (MEM)**

* **Purpose**: To read from or write to data memory.
* **Operation**:

  * If it's a **load instruction**, the memory is read using the address from the ALU.
  * If it's a **store instruction**, data from a register is written to memory.
  * Results (loaded data or ALU output) are saved in pipeline registers for write-back.

‚úÖ **Outcome**: Memory operands accessed as needed.

---

#### **5. Write Back (WB)**

* **Purpose**: To write results back into the register file.
* **Operation**:

  * For ALU operations: write the result into the **destination register**.
  * For load instructions: write the **loaded data** into the target register.
  * Only one write operation is needed per instruction.

‚úÖ **Outcome**: Final result stored for program continuity.

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of Pipelining in RISC**

* **Improved performance** via **instruction-level parallelism**.
* Each pipeline stage can work **independently** and **concurrently**.
* Helps achieve **one instruction per clock cycle** throughput (ideal case).

Real-world implementations may include additional hazard detection, forwarding units, and branch prediction logic to handle pipeline **hazards** like:

* **Data hazards**
* **Control hazards**
* **Structural hazards**
