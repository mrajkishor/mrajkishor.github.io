# üî∑ Primitive Data Types in Java

Java is a **statically-typed, strongly-typed language**, meaning every variable‚Äôs type is known at compile time and cannot be changed.  
It defines **8 primitive data types** (not objects) that serve as the building blocks of data representation.  

---

## 1. **Primitive vs Reference Types**
- **Primitives**: Simple values stored directly in memory (stack or inline within objects).  
- **Reference Types**: Objects stored on the heap; variable holds a *reference* (pointer).  
- Unlike C/C++, Java doesn‚Äôt allow user-defined primitive types ‚Äî everything else is derived from classes.  

üëâ **Why important for interviews**: Primitives avoid object overhead, which matters in high-performance systems (e.g., trading systems, large-scale data).  

---

## 2. **Categories of Primitive Data Types**
Java divides primitives into **numeric, character, and boolean**:

| Category  | Data Types                             |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Integer   | `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`         |
| Floating  | `float`, `double`                      |
| Character | `char`                                 |
| Logical   | `boolean`                              |

## 3. **Detailed Breakdown**

### üîπ 3.1 Integer Types
1. **`byte`**
   - Size: **8 bits (1 byte)**  
   - Range: **-128 to 127** (`-2^7` to `2^7-1`)  
   - Use case: memory-constrained arrays (e.g., raw file I/O, image data, network buffers).  

2. **`short`**
   - Size: **16 bits**  
   - Range: **-32,768 to 32,767**  
   - Rarely used, sometimes in legacy code where memory mattered.  

3. **`int`**
   - Size: **32 bits**  
   - Range: **-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647**  
   - Default type for integers in Java.  
   - In JVM, most arithmetic ops use `int` internally for efficiency.  

4. **`long`**
   - Size: **64 bits**  
   - Range: **-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807**  
   - Use case: timestamps (`System.currentTimeMillis()`), large IDs, big computations.  
   - Must suffix literals with `L` (`long num = 1234567890123L;`).  

---

### üîπ 3.2 Floating-Point Types
1. **`float`**
   - Size: **32 bits (single precision, IEEE 754)**  
   - Range: ~`¬±3.40282347E+38F` (approx 7 decimal digits).  
   - Must suffix with `F` (`float x = 3.14F;`).  
   - Use case: memory-sensitive apps, graphics, scientific data with lower precision.  

2. **`double`**
   - Size: **64 bits (double precision, IEEE 754)**  
   - Range: ~`¬±1.79769313486231570E+308` (approx 15‚Äì16 decimal digits).  
   - Default for floating literals in Java.  
   - Use case: general-purpose decimal computations, financial calculations (though beware of rounding errors).  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Enterprise interview trap**: Floating-point precision errors. Example:  
```java
System.out.println(0.1 + 0.2);  // prints 0.30000000000000004
```
This happens because floating-point values are represented in binary fractions, not exact decimal.  

---

### üîπ 3.3 Character Type
- **`char`**
  - Size: **16 bits**  
  - Range: `'\u0000'` (0) to `'\uffff'` (65,535)  
  - Unicode-based (not ASCII), meaning Java can represent characters from many languages.  
  - Use case: single characters, but also often used in arrays for string manipulation.  

üëâ Interview Q: Why `char` is 16-bit in Java?  
- Because Java was designed with **Unicode** support in mind from the beginning.  

---

### üîπ 3.4 Boolean Type
- **`boolean`**
  - Size: **not precisely defined by the JVM spec**.  
  - Typically represented as **1 bit logically**, but in practice stored as **1 byte** for efficiency.  
  - Values: `true` or `false`.  
  - Use case: control flow, flags.  

‚ö†Ô∏è JVM does not allow arithmetic on `boolean` (unlike C).  

---

## 4. **Default Values of Primitives**
When declared as class members (not local variables):  

| Type     | Default Value |
|----------|---------------|
| byte     | 0             |
| short    | 0             |
| int      | 0             |
| long     | 0L            |
| float    | 0.0f          |
| double   | 0.0d          |
| char     | '\u0000'      |
| boolean  | false         |

**Local variables** must be explicitly initialized, otherwise compilation error.  

---

## 5. **Memory Model & Performance**
- Primitives are typically stored on the **stack** (or inside objects on the heap).  
- Access is **fast and direct**, unlike references which require pointer dereferencing.  
- JVM internally promotes smaller types (`byte`, `short`, `char`) to `int` during arithmetic to optimize performance.  

üëâ Example:
```java
byte b1 = 10, b2 = 20;
// byte result = b1 + b2; // Compilation error
int result = b1 + b2;
```

>In brief: 
>
>Adding two __byte__ variables in Java can lead to a compile-time error if the result is assigned back to a __byte__ variable without an explicit cast. This occurs due to Java's type promotion rules during arithmetic operations.
> __Here's a breakdown of why this happens:__
> <ins>Implicit Type Promotion</ins>:
> When arithmetic operations are performed on byte (or short or char) types, Java implicitly promotes these operands to int before performing the calculation. This is done to prevent potential data loss or overflow, as the result of the operation might exceed the range of a byte.
> <ins>Result is an int</ins>:
> Consequently, the result of adding two byte variables is an int, not a byte.
> <ins>Lossy Conversion</ins>:
> If you then attempt to assign this int result back to a byte variable, the Java compiler recognizes this as a potential "lossy conversion" because an int (which can hold a larger range of values) is being converted to a byte (which has a smaller range, typically -128 to 127).
> <ins>Compile-time Error</ins>:
> To prevent unintended data loss, the Java compiler issues a "possible lossy conversion" error, requiring you to explicitly acknowledge the potential data loss by performing a cast.
> __Example__:
> ```java 
> byte a = 100;
> byte b = 50;
> byte c = a + b; // This line will cause a > compile-time error  
> ```
> __Solution__:
> To resolve this, you must explicitly cast the result of the addition back to a byte:
> ```java 
> byte a = 100;
> byte b = 50;
> byte c = (byte) (a + b); // This will compile
> ```
> Important Note: When casting back to a byte, be aware that if the int result exceeds the range of a byte (-128 to 127), the value will be truncated or "wrapped around," potentially leading to an unexpected result.

How data lose can happen?

1. Overflow/wrap-around (for integer types)

```java

int largeInt = 150;
// Binary representation of 150 (32 bits): 00000000 00000000 00000000 10010110
byte smallByte = (byte) largeInt;
// When cast to a byte, only the lowest 8 bits (10010110) are kept.
// As a signed 8-bit number, 10010110 is -106 in decimal (using two's complement).

System.out.println("Original int value: " + largeInt);
System.out.println("Casted byte value: " + smallByte);

// Output:
// Original int value: 150
// Casted byte value: -106
```

2. Truncation (for floating-point types)


__Example__: Casting double to int

```java
double dblValue = 9.78;
int intValue = (int) dblValue; // Explicitly casting double to int

System.out.println("Original double value: " + dblValue);
System.out.println("Casted int value: " + intValue);

// Output:
// Original double value: 9.78
// Casted int value: 9
```

__Example__: Loss of precision with floating-point types


```java
double preciseDouble = 3.141592653589793;
float lessPreciseFloat = (float) preciseDouble;

System.out.println("Original double value: " + preciseDouble);
System.out.println("Casted float value: " + lessPreciseFloat);

// Output (might vary slightly depending on the system):
// Original double value: 3.141592653589793
// Casted float value: 3.1415927
```

## 6. **Wrapper Classes & Autoboxing**
Every primitive has a corresponding wrapper in `java.lang`:  

| Primitive | Wrapper Class  |
|-----------|----------------|
| byte      | Byte           |
| short     | Short          |
| int       | Integer        |
| long      | Long           |
| float     | Float          |
| double    | Double         |
| char      | Character      |
| boolean   | Boolean        |

**Autoboxing/Unboxing**:  
```java
Integer x = 10;  // Autoboxing: int ‚Üí Integer
int y = x;       // Unboxing: Integer ‚Üí int
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Enterprise trap: Beware of equality check pitfalls:  
```java
Integer a = 128;
Integer b = 128;
System.out.println(a == b); // false (different objects)

Integer c = 127;
Integer d = 127;
System.out.println(c == d); // true (cached range -128 to 127)
```

In brief: 

Why Java Creates New Integer Objects Beyond 127 (or 128):

- Integer Caching Range: The Java Language Specification guarantees that Integer objects for values between -128 and 127 (inclusive) are cached and reused. This means that for values within this range, if you create two Integer objects with the same value, they will actually refer to the same underlying object in memory. For instance, Integer a = 127; Integer b = 127; results in a and b pointing to the same object, so a == b would be true.
- Values Outside the Cache: When you assign an int literal to an Integer variable, Java performs autoboxing, which implicitly calls Integer.valueOf(). If the value passed to Integer.valueOf() is outside the cached range (-128 to 127), the method will always create a new Integer object.
- Distinct Objects, Different References: As a result, when you have Integer a = 128; and Integer b = 128;, Java creates two separate Integer objects in memory, each containing the value 128. Since a and b point to different memory locations, the == operator (which compares object references) returns false. 

Why the Integer Cache is Required

The Integer cache exists as a performance optimization and to reduce memory overhead, particularly for smaller, commonly used integer values: 

- Memory Optimization:
    - Creating new objects constantly requires memory allocation on the heap. This can lead to increased memory usage and strain on the garbage collector.
    - By caching frequently used Integer objects, Java avoids repeatedly creating the same objects. This means less memory is allocated overall. Imagine a loop where you are repeatedly creating Integer objects for a value like 0 or 1. Without caching, a new object would be created each time. With caching, the same object is reused.
- Performance Improvement:
    - Object creation and garbage collection are relatively expensive operations in terms of CPU time.
    - By reusing existing Integer objects from the cache instead of creating new ones, Java reduces the overhead associated with object creation and garbage collection, leading to faster execution times.
- Frequency of Use:
    - Small integer values (e.g., counters, loop indices, status codes) are very frequently used in programming.
    - The cache range of -128 to 127 was chosen because this range covers many common use cases, striking a balance between memory usage and performance benefits. Caching the entire range of possible int values (over 4 billion) would be impractical and consume an enormous amount of memory.

## 7. **Special Notes for Interviews**
- **Numeric promotion rules**: smaller types promoted to `int` during arithmetic.  
- **`final` variables**: constant primitives are often inlined at compile time.  
- **Precision issues**: use `BigDecimal` for financial systems.  
- **Boolean size**: Not fixed in JVM spec, but practically 1 byte.
