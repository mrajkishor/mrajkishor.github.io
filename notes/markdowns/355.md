## **1️⃣ Key Features of Amazon S3**
### **🔹 Object Storage Architecture**
Amazon S3 is a **key-value store** designed for storing **objects** instead of files or blocks. Each object is uniquely identified by a key and is stored inside **S3 buckets**.

### **🔹 Scalability & Serverless**
- **Infinitely scalable** – No fixed storage limits.
- **Serverless** – AWS manages scaling, hardware, and infrastructure.
- **Maximum object size** – **5 TB per object**.
- **Versioning support** – Allows tracking and restoring previous versions of files.

### **🔹 Storage Tiers**
Amazon S3 provides different **storage classes** to optimize cost, performance, and availability:
| **Storage Class** | **Use Case** |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **S3 Standard** | Frequent access, low-latency |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** | Auto-optimizes between Standard & IA based on usage |
| **S3 Infrequent Access (IA)** | Long-lived but less frequently accessed data |
| **S3 Glacier & Glacier Deep Archive** | Long-term archival storage |
| **S3 One-Zone IA** | Cheaper than IA but stores data in **one availability zone** |

2. **Client-Side Encryption**
   - Data is encrypted before being uploaded.

### **🔹 Compliance & Auditing**
- **MFA Delete** – Prevent accidental or malicious deletions.
- **Access Logs** – Track access patterns and audit changes.

## **3️⃣ Performance & Cost Optimization**
### **🔹 Performance Features**
- **Multi-Part Uploads** – Breaks large files into chunks for parallel uploads.
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration** – Uses AWS Edge Locations for faster global uploads.
- **S3 Select & Glacier Select** – Retrieve specific data from objects without downloading the entire file.

### **🔹 Cost-Effective Storage**
- **Lifecycle Policies** – Automatically move objects between storage tiers based on access frequency.
- **Object Lock & Retention** – Prevents deletion for regulatory compliance.
