---

## **12.1 Overview of Mass Storage Structure**

* **Mass storage** = Non-volatile, large-capacity devices like HDDs, SSDs, optical disks, magnetic tapes.
* Primary focus here: **Magnetic Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)**.

**HDD Components:**

1. **Platter** – Circular disk coated with magnetic material.
2. **Track** – Concentric circles on platter.
3. **Sector** – Smallest addressable block (usually 512 bytes or 4 KB).
4. **Cylinder** – Set of tracks aligned vertically across platters.
5. **Disk Arm** – Moves read/write head.
6. **Head** – Reads/writes magnetic patterns.

**Performance Parameters:**

* **Seek Time (Ts)** – Time to move head to correct track.
* **Rotational Latency (Tr)** – Time waiting for desired sector to rotate under head.
* **Transfer Time (Tt)** – Time to move data from disk to memory.
* **Average Access Time** = Ts + Tr + Tt.

## **12.2 Magnetic Disks**

**Structure & Operation:**

* Platters spin continuously.
* Data read/written via moving head.
* Modern HDDs use **zoned bit recording** (more sectors on outer tracks).

**Disk Scheduling Need:**

* Multiple I/O requests queued.
* OS decides **order** to service them to minimize seek + latency.

**Reliability & Maintenance:**

* **Bad sectors** marked unusable.
* **Disk failure** → handled with backup, RAID, or replication.

## **12.3 Disk Scheduling**

Scheduling affects performance significantly.

**Algorithms:**

1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**

   * Serve in order of arrival.
   * Fair but may cause long average seek time.

2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**

   * Choose request closest to current head position.
   * Reduces seek time but can cause starvation.

3. **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**

   * Head moves in one direction, servicing requests until end, then reverses.
   * More uniform wait time.

4. **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**

   * Like SCAN, but after reaching end, jumps back to start without servicing on return.
   * Provides more uniform service.

5. **LOOK / C-LOOK**

   * SCAN/C-SCAN but reverses or wraps only up to last request in queue (not full end).

**Performance Metric:**

* **Average Seek Time** — main target for minimization.

## **12.4 RAID Structure (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**

RAID = Combine multiple disks for **performance and/or reliability**.

**RAID Levels:**

* **RAID 0 (Striping)** – Data split across disks; high speed, no redundancy.
* **RAID 1 (Mirroring)** – Duplicate data on two disks; high reliability, storage cost 2x.
* **RAID 5** – Block-level striping with distributed parity; good balance of speed + fault tolerance.
* **RAID 6** – Like RAID 5 but with double parity; can survive 2 disk failures.

**Why RAID?**

* Performance gain via parallel reads/writes.
* Reliability via redundancy.

## **12.5 Disk Attachment**

How disks are connected to the computer:

1. **Host-Attached Storage**

   * Directly connected via interfaces like SATA, SAS, NVMe.
   * Controlled by OS I/O subsystem.

2. **Network-Attached Storage (NAS)**

   * Storage device connected over LAN via NFS, SMB/CIFS protocols.
   * Appears as a shared folder to clients.

3. **Storage-Area Network (SAN)**

   * High-speed specialized network for storage.
   * Uses protocols like Fibre Channel or iSCSI.

## **GATE Exam Pointers**

* **Numerical**:

  * Average seek time & access time calculations.
  * Disk scheduling problems (especially SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN).
* **Conceptual**:

  * Difference between SCAN vs LOOK.
  * RAID level advantages/disadvantages.
  * Access time formula.
  * NAS vs SAN vs Direct Attached Storage.
