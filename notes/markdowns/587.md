# 🔍 Explain Plan & Analyzing Queries in MongoDB

When working with large datasets in MongoDB, optimizing query performance becomes crucial. While creating indexes is an essential step, **understanding how those indexes are used** is even more critical.

MongoDB provides the `explain()` method — a powerful tool that reveals **how a query is executed**, which indexes are used, how many documents were scanned, and much more.

---

## 📌 What is `explain()` in MongoDB?

The `explain()` method shows detailed information about the **execution plan** for a given query. It helps answer questions like:

* Did MongoDB use an index?
* Was there a **collection scan**?
* How many documents were examined vs. returned?
* What is the **execution time**?

---

## 🔧 Syntax

```js
db.collection.find({ ... }).explain()
```

### You can also pass a verbosity mode:

* `"queryPlanner"` (default) – high-level info
* `"executionStats"` – includes time and document scan count
* `"allPlansExecution"` – includes stats for all considered plans

Example:

```js
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } }).explain("executionStats")
```

---

## 🧠 Key Components of Explain Output

### 1. **queryPlanner**

Shows how MongoDB planned to execute the query.

* **winningPlan**: the plan MongoDB chose
* **stage**: the operation performed (e.g., `COLLSCAN`, `IXSCAN`)
* **indexName**: name of the index used (if any)

### 2. **executionStats**

Shows real runtime stats.

* `nReturned`: number of documents returned
* `executionTimeMillis`: time taken to run the query
* `totalDocsExamined`: how many documents MongoDB scanned
* `totalKeysExamined`: how many index keys were scanned

### 3. **allPlansExecution** (Optional)

Compares performance of all plans considered, including those **not chosen**.

## ⚠️ Common Stages You’ll See

| Stage        | Description                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `COLLSCAN`   | Full collection scan (slow, no index used)           |
| `IXSCAN`     | Index scan (fast)                                    |
| `FETCH`      | After index scan, fetches actual documents           |
| `SORT`       | In-memory sort (expensive if not supported by index) |
| `PROJECTION` | Includes/excludes specified fields                   |

## 🔍 Example Analysis

### Query:

```js
db.users.find({ email: "a@b.com" }).explain("executionStats")
```

### Output (simplified):

```json
{
  "queryPlanner": {
    "winningPlan": {
      "stage": "IXSCAN",
      "indexName": "email_1"
    }
  },
  "executionStats": {
    "nReturned": 1,
    "executionTimeMillis": 2,
    "totalDocsExamined": 1,
    "totalKeysExamined": 1
  }
}
```

### Interpretation:

* ✅ Index used (`email_1`)
* ✅ Only 1 document examined
* ⚡ Query is optimized and fast

---

## 🔍 Bad Query Example

### Query:

```js
db.users.find({ firstName: "Alice", lastName: "Smith" })
```

### But index only exists on `{ firstName: 1 }`

### Output:

```json
{
  "winningPlan": {
    "stage": "COLLSCAN"
  },
  "executionStats": {
    "totalDocsExamined": 100000,
    "nReturned": 1
  }
}
```

### Interpretation:

* ❌ No compound index for both fields
* ❌ Full collection scanned
* 🛠️ Fix: Create compound index on `{ firstName: 1, lastName: 1 }`

## ✅ Best Practices for Query Analysis

| Tip                  | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use `executionStats` | Always run `explain("executionStats")` to measure actual performance.               |
| Avoid `COLLSCAN`     | Aim for `IXSCAN` in most read-heavy queries.                                        |
| Check sort stages    | If stage includes `SORT`, consider creating a compound index that supports sorting. |
| Use covered queries  | Use projection and index together to avoid fetching documents (`FETCH`).            |
| Analyze write ops    | Use `explain()` on `update()` or `delete()` to ensure indexed paths.                |

## 🚀 Summary

`explain()` is your go-to tool for **understanding and optimizing MongoDB queries**. Use it regularly during development and performance audits. Just creating indexes isn’t enough — ensure your queries **actually use them**.
