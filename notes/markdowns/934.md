# 🧠 Java: Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference 

One of the **most misunderstood topics in Java interviews** — even at senior levels — is how Java handles function argument passing.

Let’s clear this up right from the start:

> ✅ **Java is strictly "pass by value" — always.**
> But there’s nuance in what that “value” actually is when it comes to objects.

---

## 🔹 What is "Pass by Value" in Java?

When you pass a variable to a method, Java passes a **copy of the value stored in that variable**.

### 👉 For **primitives**, this is easy:

You pass a copy of the actual data. Changing it inside the method doesn't affect the original.

```java
public class Test {
    public static void change(int x) {
        x = 99;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 10;
        change(num);
        System.out.println(num);  // Output: 10 ❌ (unchanged)
    }
}
```

> 💡 **Why?** The method gets a copy of `num`, not the original. You're modifying the copy, not the source.

---

## 🔹 What about Objects?

Here’s where most people get confused.

In Java, **object variables** (like `Student s = new Student();`) store **references** — i.e., memory addresses.

So when you pass an object to a method:

* Java passes **a copy of that reference**.
* The method can **change the object's fields**, but **cannot change the original reference itself**.

### 📌 Example 1: Mutating fields ✅

```java
class Student {
    String name;
}

public class Test {
    public static void update(Student s) {
        s.name = "Alice";  // changes original object
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student stu = new Student();
        stu.name = "Bob";
        update(stu);
        System.out.println(stu.name);  // Alice ✅
    }
}
```

### 📌 Example 2: Reassigning reference ❌

```java
public class Test {
    public static void reassign(Student s) {
        s = new Student(); // new object, but only local to method
        s.name = "Charlie";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student stu = new Student();
        stu.name = "Bob";
        reassign(stu);
        System.out.println(stu.name);  // Bob ❌ (not Charlie)
    }
}
```

> 💡 **Why?** The copy of the reference was modified inside `reassign()`, but the original variable `stu` still points to the old object.

---

## 🔍 Visual Mental Model

* **Primitive** → copy of value → safe to change (no side effects)
* **Object** → copy of reference → changes to internal state affect original, but reassignment doesn’t

---

## 🧩 Why This Matters in Real-World Java

1. **Mutable shared state bugs**
   Accidentally modifying objects in methods can cause race conditions or unintended side-effects in large systems.

2. **Immutability patterns**
   You’ll often see defensive copying or use of immutable objects in enterprise-grade code (e.g., with Lombok or Java Records).

3. **Design principles**
   Understanding argument passing influences how you write clean APIs, design DTOs, or manage model transformations.

## ✅ TL;DR

| Type      | What’s Passed       | Can Method Modify It?                            | Notes      |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Primitive | Actual value (copy) | ❌ No                                             | Safe       |
| Object    | Reference (copy)    | ✅ Yes (internal fields), ❌ No (reference itself) | Be careful |

---

## 🔥 Enterprise Interview Tip

If asked, **don't say Java is pass by reference** — that's technically wrong.

✅ Instead, say:

> “Java is always pass by value. For objects, the value is a reference, so you can mutate the object’s state inside the method, but you can’t change what the caller’s variable points to.”

That shows **clarity and depth** — exactly what top companies are looking for.

---

> Q. __What about plain string. That is call by value right!!__


Yes — you're absolutely right.

In **Java**, a plain `String` is passed **by value**, just like any other object reference — but with one important twist:

> 🔒 **Strings in Java are immutable**, so they behave *as if* they were primitives when passed to methods.

---

## ✅ Java Strings: Passed by Value

When you pass a `String` to a method:

* A **copy of the reference** is passed (just like any object).
* But since you **can’t change the internal content** of a `String` (because it's immutable), it feels like you're passing a primitive.

---

### 📌 Example:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void modify(String str) {
        str = str + " World";  // new String object created
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "Hello";
        modify(message);
        System.out.println(message);  // Output: Hello ❌ (not Hello World)
    }
}
```

> 💡 Even though `str` is a reference, the new `"Hello World"` string is assigned to the **local copy** of the reference — it doesn't affect `message`.

---

### 🧠 Why This Behavior Confuses People

Because you **can** mutate objects like `StringBuilder`, but **cannot** mutate a `String`. So people assume `String` is "passed by value" in a different way.

But the truth is:

> ✅ **Java passes the reference by value. But since `String` is immutable, you can’t modify its internal value — only reassign.**

---

### 🆚 Compare with Mutable Object

```java
public class Test {
    public static void modify(StringBuilder sb) {
        sb.append(" World");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        modify(sb);
        System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello World ✅ (mutated)
    }
}
```

---

## 🔍 Summary: Strings in Java

| Type            | Immutable | Can Modify in Method? | Behavior                 |
| --------------- | --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `String`        | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No                  | Feels like primitive     |
| `StringBuilder` | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes                 | Standard object behavior |

---

So yes — **`String` is passed by value**, like all other types in Java — but since it's immutable, you can't do much with it inside a method except reassign (which won’t affect the caller).
