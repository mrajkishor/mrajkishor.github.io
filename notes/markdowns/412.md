# ⚙️ Worker Threads in Node.js — True Multithreading with JavaScript

Node.js is traditionally known for being **single-threaded**, built on the **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model**. While this works beautifully for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., HTTP requests, file reads), it **struggles with CPU-intensive operations** like:

- Image processing  
- Video encoding  
- Complex calculations  
- Data compression  

To fix that, Node.js introduced the **`worker_threads`** module in **v10.5.0** (stable in v12+), enabling **true multithreading** within a single Node.js process.

---

## 🔍 What Are Worker Threads?

`Worker Threads` allow you to **run JavaScript code in parallel** threads, using:

- A **main thread** (the default event loop),
- One or more **worker threads**, each with its own event loop and memory.

This means you can **offload CPU-heavy tasks** to workers, keeping the main thread **free and responsive**.

---

## 🧠 When to Use Worker Threads?

✅ Great for:
- Heavy CPU-bound logic (e.g., encryption, hashing, compression)
- Real-time data processing
- Machine learning model inference
- Parallel file parsing or batch operations

❌ Not ideal for:
- Simple I/O tasks (use async I/O instead)
- Massive process spawning (use clustering or external queues)

---

## 📦 Installing (if required)

The `worker_threads` module is **built-in** — no npm install needed.

---

## 🛠 Basic Example

### 📁 `main.js`
```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

function runService(workerData) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const worker = new Worker('./worker.js', { workerData });

    worker.on('message', resolve);
    worker.on('error', reject);
    worker.on('exit', code => {
      if (code !== 0)
        reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
    });
  });
}

runService({ num: 42 }).then(result => {
  console.log('Result from worker:', result);
});
```

### 📁 `worker.js`
```js
const { parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

// Simulate heavy task
let result = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 1e8; i++) {
  result += workerData.num;
}

parentPort.postMessage(result);
```

### 📤 Output:
```bash
Result from worker: 4200000000
```

---

## 🔄 Communication Between Threads

Worker and main thread communicate via:

- `workerData`: Data sent when spawning the worker
- `parentPort.postMessage()`: Sending result back
- Event listeners: `worker.on('message')`, `worker.on('error')`, etc.

Also supports **`MessageChannel`** and **`SharedArrayBuffer`** for more advanced shared-memory use cases.

## 📎 Real-World Use Cases

- 👨‍💻 Hashing passwords with bcrypt
- 🧮 Calculating large Fibonacci series
- 📦 Compressing uploaded files on the fly
- 📊 Analyzing large CSV or JSON files
- 🧠 Offloading TensorFlow.js model inference

---

## 🧪 Best Practices

- Always handle worker termination gracefully.
- Use thread pools (e.g., [`poolifier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poolifier)) for repeated tasks.
- Avoid blocking the main thread — offload anything heavy.
- Set up timeouts and fallbacks for unresponsive workers.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Slightly more complex than async/await.
- Cannot share variables directly — must use messages or SharedArrayBuffer.
- Debugging workers can be trickier.

---

## 🚀 Bonus: Thread Pool Libraries

- [`Piscina`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/piscina): Fastest thread pool for Node
- [`Poolifier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poolifier): Easy to scale workers with fallback handling

---

**Note:**

**Worker Threads are different in Node.js and on the Client (Browser)** — although they serve a similar purpose: **parallelism / offloading work from the main thread**.

---

## 🧠 Key Differences: Node.js vs Client (Browser)

| Feature                      | **Node.js Worker Threads**                      | **Browser Web Workers**                             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| API Name                    | `worker_threads` module                          | `Web Worker` or `Service Worker`                    |
| Primary Use                 | Offload **CPU-heavy** backend tasks              | Offload **UI-blocking** logic like animations, DOM  |
| Shared Memory               | ✅ Yes (`SharedArrayBuffer`)                     | ✅ Yes (`SharedArrayBuffer`, `Atomics`)             |
| File Format                 | Runs `.js` or `.ts` backend files                | Requires separate `.js` file                        |
| Access to APIs              | Full access to Node.js APIs (fs, crypto, etc.)   | Limited to browser APIs (no DOM in Web Worker)      |
| Main Thread Access          | No access to main thread variables               | No access to DOM or main thread variables           |
| Communication               | `postMessage()` / `parentPort`                  | `postMessage()`                                     |
| Module Support              | ✅ Native ES modules and CommonJS                | ✅ ES modules only (with type="module")             |
| Threading Behavior          | True multi-threading using V8 isolates           | Event-loop based threads with worker isolation      |

---

## 📦 Example of Each

### ✅ Node.js `worker_threads`
```js
// worker.js
const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');
parentPort.postMessage("Hi from Node worker!");
```

### ✅ Browser Web Worker
```js
// worker.js
self.postMessage("Hi from Web Worker!");
```

---

## 🧪 In Short:
- **Node.js**: Worker threads are meant for **server-side parallelism** using OS threads.
- **Browser**: Workers are for **non-blocking UI**, like async image processing, long loops, etc.

---

### About Shared Memory

In both **Node.js worker threads** and **browser Web Workers**, **shared memory** refers to the ability to **share data between threads without copying it**, using a special object called **`SharedArrayBuffer`**.

---

## 🧠 What is Shared Memory?

Normally, when you send data between threads (main thread ↔ worker), it’s **copied**, which is slow for large data.

With **shared memory**, both threads **access the same memory location**, so:
- No copying happens ✅
- Changes made by one thread are instantly visible to the other ✅

---

## 🧩 Key APIs

| API                | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `SharedArrayBuffer` | Allocates a block of memory accessible by all threads |
| `TypedArray`        | Allows you to read/write data inside that buffer |
| `Atomics`           | Provides thread-safe operations on shared data   |
  
---

## 🔧 Node.js Example (Shared Memory)
```js
const { Worker, isMainThread, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
  const shared = new SharedArrayBuffer(4); // 4 bytes
  const view = new Int32Array(shared);
  view[0] = 42;

  const worker = new Worker(__filename, { workerData: shared });

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Main sees:", view[0]); // Updated by worker
  }, 1000);
} else {
  const view = new Int32Array(workerData);
  view[0] += 1; // Modify shared memory
}
```

---

## 🖥 Browser Example
```js
// main.js
const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(4);
const view = new Int32Array(sab);
view[0] = 10;

const worker = new Worker("worker.js");
worker.postMessage(sab);

// worker.js
onmessage = e => {
  const view = new Int32Array(e.data);
  view[0] += 5;
};
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Shared memory is **low-level** — no objects, only binary data (numbers, bytes).
- You must use `Atomics` to **prevent race conditions** when multiple threads write.
- It’s mainly used in **performance-critical apps** like games, data visualization, ML, etc.

---

## ✅ Summary

**Shared memory = fast, zero-copy communication using SharedArrayBuffer.**  
Used in both Node.js and browsers, it's like having **a shared notebook** both threads can write to — but you’ll need to be careful they don’t write on the same line at once 😉
