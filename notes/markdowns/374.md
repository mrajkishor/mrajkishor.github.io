# 🔍 Understanding CIDR – IPv4

## What is CIDR?

CIDR stands for **Classless Inter-Domain Routing**. It is a flexible method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. It was introduced to replace the old system based on classes A, B, and C, offering more granular control over IP address allocation.

CIDR is widely used in cloud platforms such as **AWS**, particularly in **Security Group rules** and **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** networking.

> Classful IP addressing is considered outdated and largely obsolete, having been superseded by CIDR in 1993.

## 📌 Why CIDR is Important in AWS

When configuring security groups in AWS, you often need to specify which IPs or range of IPs are allowed to connect to your services, such as SSH (port 22) or HTTP (port 80).

### Example:

| Type | Protocol | Port | Source           |
|------|----------|------|------------------|
| SSH  | TCP      | 22   | 122.149.196.85/32 |
| HTTP | TCP      | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0         |

- **`/32`** = Only one specific IP is allowed.
- **`/0`** = All IPs are allowed (not secure for SSH!).

## 🧱 CIDR Structure

CIDR notation consists of two components:

1. **Base IP Address**
   - Example: `10.0.0.0`, `192.168.0.0`
2. **Subnet Mask (Prefix Length)**
   - Example: `/0`, `/24`, `/32`
   - ==Indicates how many bits are fixed in the IP address.==

## 🎯 CIDR and Subnet Mask

The subnet mask tells how many bits of the IP are fixed and how many can vary:

| CIDR   | Subnet Mask       | IP Range                      |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| `/8`   | 255.0.0.0         | 16M addresses                 |
| `/16`  | 255.255.0.0       | 65,536 addresses              |
| `/24`  | 255.255.255.0     | 256 addresses                 |
| `/32`  | 255.255.255.255   | 1 address (exact match only)  |

## 🔁 Visualizing IP Ranges with CIDR

Let’s take `192.168.0.0` as the base IP and explore how different CIDR notations affect the range:

| CIDR        | IP Range                                 | No. of IPs   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `/32`       | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.0                 | 1            |
| `/31`       | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.1                 | 2            |
| `/30`       | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.3                 | 4            |
| `/29`       | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.7                 | 8            |
| `/28`       | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.15                | 16           |
| `/27`       | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.31                | 32           |
| `/26`       | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.63                | 64           |
| `/24`       | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.255               | 256          |
| `/16`       | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255             | 65,536       |
| `/0`        | 0.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255                 | All IPs      |

📝 **Quick Memo**:
- `/32`: no change in any octet
- `/24`: only the last octet can vary
- `/16`: last two octets can vary
- `/8`: last three octets can vary
- `/0`: all four octets can vary

## 🧠 Little Exercise

Try guessing the range:

- `192.168.0.0/24` → `192.168.0.0` – `192.168.0.255` (256 IPs)
- `192.168.0.0/16` → `192.168.0.0` – `192.168.255.255` (65,536 IPs)
- `134.56.78.123/32` → Only `134.56.78.123`
- `0.0.0.0/0` → All IPs on the internet!

## ✅ Conclusion

CIDR is a powerful concept that lets you:
- Define exact IPs or ranges for network security.
- Control access more granularly in environments like AWS.
- Understand networking fundamentals like subnets and masks.

Learning CIDR is essential for working with **cloud platforms, firewalls, VPNs, and routers**.
