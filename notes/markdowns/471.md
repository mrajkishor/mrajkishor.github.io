Here’s a solid list of **React interview questions**, grouped by topic — these are commonly asked in mid-to-senior frontend roles.

---

## 🔹 1. **React Fundamentals**
- Explain the virtual DOM and reconciliation process.
- How does React batch updates? When does it not?
- What happens when you call `setState()`?
- Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components.
- What are keys in React and why are they important?

---

## 🔹 2. **Hooks**
- Explain `useEffect` dependency behavior.
- What's the difference between `useRef`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`?
- How would you implement your own `useDebounce` or `useThrottle`?
- How do you avoid stale closures in hooks?
- When does `useLayoutEffect` make sense over `useEffect`?

---

## 🔹 3. **Performance Optimization**
- How do you optimize rendering in large React applications?
- When should you use `React.memo` or `useMemo`?
- How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders in deeply nested trees?
- How would you implement lazy loading for components or routes?

---

## 🔹 4. **Advanced Patterns**
- How would you implement a custom hook for form state?
- What's the difference between HOC and Render Props?
- Can you implement a custom context provider with dynamic context?
- How does React handle state updates in concurrent rendering?

---

## 🔹 5. **React Internals**
- What is the fiber architecture and why was it introduced?
- What happens under the hood during reconciliation?
- How does React's diffing algorithm work with lists?

---

## 🔹 6. **Testing**
- How do you test hooks using RTL + Jest?
- How would you test component interaction with `fireEvent` and async APIs?
- How do you mock React context or global state in tests?

---

## 🔹 7. **System Design (React-specific)**
- How would you design a component library?
- How do you structure a large-scale React app (monorepo, microfrontends)?
- Design a reusable notification system.
- Design a search input with debounce, maxWait, and async suggestions.

---

## 🔹 8. **Real-World Scenarios**
- Why might your input lag in a large form and how do you fix it?
- How would you migrate a class-based app to functional components + hooks?
- How do you handle deep prop drilling without redux or context?

---

## ✅ Bonus: Coding Challenges
- Implement a `debounce` or `throttle` hook
- Build a `TimeLimitedCache` or `LRU` store in React
- Create a `useUndoRedo()` hook
- Write a virtualized list component from scratch
- Build an infinite scroll list with Intersection Observer

## 🔁 React Hooks Challenges

1. **🧠 `useUndoRedo` hook**
   - Track state changes and support `.undo()` and `.redo()`

2. **⏱ `useThrottle` and `useDebounce`**
   - Build both with optional `maxWait` support

3. **🪝 `useWhyDidYouUpdate`**
   - Custom hook that logs why a component re-rendered (show changed props)

4. **📶 `useOnlineStatus`**
   - Hook that tracks online/offline status using `navigator.onLine`

5. **🔐 `useAuth` or `useSession`**
   - Hook to handle authentication status and role-based checks

6. **🔍 `useSearch`**
   - Debounced search with async results, loading state, and error handling

---

## 🧱 Component Design Challenges

7. **📦 Accordion / Tabs / Modal from scratch**
   - Handle accessibility, animations, and keyboard navigation

8. **💬 Notification System**
   - Toast queue with auto-dismiss, animation, and multiple types (info, error, etc.)

9. **🪟 Window Manager**
   - Resizable, draggable window components (like VS Code tabs)

10. **🔁 Virtual List / Infinite Scroll**
   - Efficiently render huge lists (thousands of items) with virtualization

11. **🧩 Dynamic Form Builder**
   - Render and validate forms based on a JSON schema

---

## 🔧 State & Logic Challenges

12. **🧠 TimeLimitedCache / LRU Cache**
   - Like the ones you already built: add TTL + LRU eviction

13. **🌲 Component Tree Inspector**
   - Create a tool that shows the component structure and re-render counts

14. **📊 useInterval + useTimeout hooks**
   - Like `setInterval` but React-safe, with pause/resume/reset options

15. **📂 File Uploader with Preview**
   - Drag/drop area, image previews, upload queue with cancel + retry

---

## 🧪 Testing Challenges

16. **🧪 Component Testing with RTL**
   - Write tests for form validation, API interaction, keyboard nav

17. **🧼 Mock Context and Redux**
   - Fully test a component using context/state without relying on the real provider

---

## 🧩 Framework/Architecture Challenges

18. **⚛️ Build a Microfrontend Shell**
   - Load and mount independent React apps dynamically

19. **🎛 Settings Panel**
   - Modular settings system with save/apply/reset, auto-persisted in localStorage

20. **🔄 Synced Tabs**
   - Keep state in sync across multiple browser tabs using `BroadcastChannel` or `storage` events
