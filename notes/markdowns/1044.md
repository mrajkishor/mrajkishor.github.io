## 📘 Graph Theory – Introduction

### 🔹 Topic: **Types of Graphs (Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted)**

## 🔹 1. What is a Graph?

A **graph** is a mathematical model used to represent **relationships** between entities.

Formally,

```
G = (V, E)
```

* `V`: Set of vertices (nodes)
* `E`: Set of edges (connections between vertices)

Depending on how edges behave, graphs are categorized into different **types**.

## 🔹 2. Directed vs Undirected Graphs

### ✅ A. Undirected Graph

* Edges have **no direction**.
* An edge between `u` and `v` means you can go **both ways**.
* Denoted as: `(u, v) ∈ E` implies `(v, u) ∈ E`

📌 **Use-case Examples**:

* Friendship network (friendship is mutual)
* Road maps without one-ways

📉 **Visualization**:

```
A ----- B
```

### ✅ B. Directed Graph (Digraph)

* Edges have **direction**, represented with an arrow.
* An edge from `u` to `v` allows movement only from `u → v`
* Denoted as: `<u, v>`

📌 **Use-case Examples**:

* Twitter follow graph (you may follow someone, but they don’t follow back)
* Flow of control in a program (function calls, dependencies)

📉 **Visualization**:

```
A ---> B
```

## 🔹 3. Weighted vs Unweighted Graphs

### ✅ A. Unweighted Graph

* Edges carry **no value or weight**.
* Used where **connectivity** matters, but not the cost or distance.

📌 Examples:

* Unweighted social network
* Pure connection mapping (yes/no type)

### ✅ B. Weighted Graph

* Each edge has an associated **weight** or cost.
* Used to represent **distance**, **time**, **cost**, **capacity**, etc.
* Denoted as `(u, v, w)` where `w` is the weight

📌 Examples:

* Road networks with distance/time
* Networks with bandwidth
* Graphs for Dijkstra’s, Prim’s algorithms (GATE-relevant)

📉 **Visualization**:

```
A ---5--- B
```

| Graph Type     | Edge Direction | Edge Weight | Example Use-Case                      |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Undirected** | ❌ No           | ❌ Optional  | Mutual relationships, LAN cables      |
| **Directed**   | ✅ Yes          | ❌ Optional  | Web links, social follows, task flow  |
| **Unweighted** | ❌ N/A          | ❌ No        | Simple connectivity, topological sort |
| **Weighted**   | ❌/✅ Either     | ✅ Yes       | GPS routing, minimum spanning tree    |

## 🔹 5. Additional Terms (GATE Useful)

| Term                    | Meaning                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Graph**        | No loops or multiple edges                                    |
| **Multigraph**          | Graph with multiple edges between same nodes                  |
| **Self-loop**           | Edge that connects a vertex to itself                         |
| **Mixed Graph**         | Contains both directed and undirected edges                   |
| **Complete Graph (Kn)** | Every pair of distinct vertices is connected (n(n−1)/2 edges) |

## 🔹 6. GATE PYQ-Style MCQs

### Q1. Which of the following graphs must have an equal number of in-degrees and out-degrees?

**A.** Weighted Graph
**B.** Directed Graph
**C.** Undirected Graph
**D.** None of the above

✅ **Answer:** B
(Each edge in a directed graph contributes +1 to in-degree and +1 to out-degree.)

---

### Q2. In which graph can edge weights be negative?

**A.** Directed Unweighted
**B.** Directed Weighted
**C.** Undirected Unweighted
**D.** None of the above

✅ **Answer:** B
(Dijkstra’s algorithm doesn’t support negative weights, but **Bellman-Ford does**.)

---

### Q3. Which graph type is best suited for representing city maps with distance information?

**A.** Undirected Unweighted
**B.** Directed Unweighted
**C.** Undirected Weighted
**D.** Directed Weighted

✅ **Answer:** C
(City roads usually allow two-way travel with known distances.)

## 🔍 GATE-Specific Tips

* **Dijkstra’s**, **Prim’s**, and **Kruskal’s** use **weighted graphs**
* Graph representation (Adjacency List/Matrix) varies with graph type
* Practice converting problem statements into correct graph types
* Know when **directed/undirected** or **weighted/unweighted** graphs are implied even if not explicitly mentioned
