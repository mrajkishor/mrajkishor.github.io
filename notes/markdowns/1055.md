###  Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

---

## 🚀 Introduction

The **Floyd–Warshall algorithm** is a **dynamic programming-based approach** for solving the **All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)** problem — i.e., it computes the shortest distances **between every pair of vertices** in a **weighted graph**.

It works for:

* **Directed or Undirected graphs**
* **Graphs with positive and negative edge weights**
* But **not with negative weight cycles**

---

## 🎯 Key Idea

The core idea of Floyd–Warshall is:

> For each pair of vertices `(i, j)`, check whether an **intermediate vertex `k`** improves the shortest distance between `i` and `j`.

---

### 📌 Recurrence Relation:

$$
dist[i][j] = \min(dist[i][j],\ dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
$$

Where:

* `dist[i][j]` is the current shortest distance from `i` to `j`
* `k` is the intermediate node being considered

---

## 🧠 When to Use

Use Floyd–Warshall when:

* You need **shortest paths between all pairs**
* The number of vertices is **small (V ≤ 500)**
* The graph **may contain negative edge weights**
* You want to **detect negative cycles**

## 📚 Algorithm Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Distance Matrix

Let the input graph be represented as an adjacency matrix `graph[V][V]`.

```python
# Initialize distance as given
dist[i][j] = graph[i][j]  # direct edge weight
dist[i][i] = 0            # distance to self = 0
```

---

### Step 2: Apply Dynamic Programming

```python
for k in range(V):               # intermediate node
    for i in range(V):           # source node
        for j in range(V):       # destination node
            if dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]:
                dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
```

---

### Step 3: Detect Negative Cycles

After completion:

```python
for i in range(V):
    if dist[i][i] < 0:
        print("Negative cycle detected!")
```

## 🔍 Dry Run Example

### Given:

```plaintext
Graph:
    0 → 1 (3)
    0 → 2 (∞)
    1 → 2 (1)
    2 → 0 (2)
```

### Initial Matrix:

```
dist = [
    [0, 3, ∞],
    [∞, 0, 1],
    [2, ∞, 0]
]
```

### After Floyd-Warshall:

```
dist = [
    [0, 3, 4],
    [3, 0, 1],
    [2, 5, 0]
]
```

## 🔁 Implementation in Python

```python
def floyd_warshall(graph):
    V = len(graph)
    dist = [[float('inf')] * V for _ in range(V)]

    # Initialize distance matrix
    for i in range(V):
        for j in range(V):
            dist[i][j] = graph[i][j]
        dist[i][i] = 0

    # Main Floyd-Warshall logic
    for k in range(V):
        for i in range(V):
            for j in range(V):
                if dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]:
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]

    # Check for negative cycle
    for i in range(V):
        if dist[i][i] < 0:
            print("Negative cycle exists!")
            return

    return dist
```
