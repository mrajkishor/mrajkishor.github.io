# HCF and LCM Usecases & Casestudies:

### 1. Highest Common Factor (HCF)

* The **Highest Common Factor (HCF)**, also called the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**, is the largest number that divides two or more numbers exactly.
* **Example**:
  HCF(12, 18) = 6 (since 6 is the biggest number dividing both 12 and 18).

**Properties**

* HCF always divides the difference of the numbers.
* HCF(a, b) × LCM(a, b) = a × b (for two positive integers).
* If numbers are co-prime, HCF = 1.

---

### 2. Least Common Multiple (LCM)

* The **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two or more numbers is the smallest positive number that is divisible by all of them.
* **Example**:
  LCM(12, 18) = 36 (since 36 is the smallest number divisible by both 12 and 18).

**Properties**

* LCM is always greater than or equal to the largest of the numbers.
* The product of two numbers = HCF × LCM.
* If numbers are co-prime, LCM = product of the numbers.

### 3. Methods to Find

* **Listing multiples/factors** (small numbers).
* **Prime factorization method** (break into primes).
* **Division/Euclidean algorithm** (for HCF).
* **Relation formula**: HCF × LCM = product of the numbers.

### 4. Use Cases

#### Use Cases of **HCF**

* **Equal distribution**: Dividing things into the largest possible equal groups.
  *Example*: If you have 18 apples and 24 oranges, HCF(18, 24) = 6 → you can make 6 baskets, each with equal apples and oranges.
* **Simplifying fractions**: Reduce fractions to lowest terms using HCF.
  *Example*: 18/24 → divide numerator and denominator by HCF(18,24)=6 → 3/4.
* **Optimization in cutting or tiling**: Cutting ropes, fabric, or flooring tiles into equal maximum lengths without leftovers.

---

#### Use Cases of **LCM**

* **Synchronizing events**: Finding when two repeating events happen together.
  *Example*: A bell rings every 12 minutes, another every 18 minutes → they ring together every LCM(12,18)=36 minutes.
* **Adding/Subtracting fractions**: LCM of denominators is used to find a common denominator.
* **Scheduling/Planning**: If buses/trains arrive at different intervals, LCM tells when they coincide.
* **Manufacturing and packaging**: LCM helps in finding the minimum size of a container or batch that fits all cycle lengths.

✅ **Key Takeaway**:

* Use **HCF** when dividing things into **largest equal parts**.
* Use **LCM** when bringing things together into a **common cycle or unit**.

## Case studies: 

Let’s add **real-life case studies** for both HCF and LCM so it’s easy to remember their practical value.

# Case Studies: HCF and LCM in Real Life

---

## **Case Study 1: HCF – Dividing into Equal Groups**

**Background**
A school has 36 boys and 48 girls for a sports event. The organizer wants to form teams such that each team has the **same number of boys and girls**, and every student participates without leftovers.

**Problem**
How many maximum teams can be formed?

**Solution (using HCF)**

* HCF(36, 48) = 12
* So, the maximum teams = **12**.
* Each team will have 3 boys and 4 girls.

**Broader Impact**
==HCF helps in situations where resources must be **divided equally without wastage**, such as arranging chairs, cutting ribbons, or distributing goods.==

## **Case Study 2: LCM – Synchronizing Repetitive Events**

**Background**
In a temple, one bell rings every 8 minutes and another bell rings every 12 minutes. A priest wants to know when both bells will ring together again.

**Problem**
After how many minutes do both bells ring at the same time?

**Solution (using LCM)**

* LCM(8, 12) = 24
* So, both bells ring together every **24 minutes**.

**Broader Impact**
==LCM helps in **synchronization problems**—traffic lights, production machines, buses/trains schedules, or planets orbiting with different periods.==

## **Case Study 3: Combined Use of HCF and LCM in Production**

**Background**
A factory produces two products. Machine A finishes a cycle in 15 minutes, and Machine B in 20 minutes. At the same time, the manager wants to **package** these products into boxes without leftovers.

**Problems**

1. How often do the machines complete cycles together?
2. What’s the largest number of boxes in which items can be equally packed?

**Solution**

1. For cycles together → LCM(15, 20) = 60 → Every **1 hour**, both machines finish together.
2. For packaging → Suppose 150 items of A and 100 items of B → HCF(150, 100) = 50 → The manager can make **50 equal boxes** with no waste.

**Broader Impact**
Factories use HCF for **packaging and grouping**, and LCM for **synchronizing cycles or processes**.

✅ **Key Takeaway from Stories**

* **HCF** is about **division and equal sharing**.
* **LCM** is about **synchronization and common timing**.
