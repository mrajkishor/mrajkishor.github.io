## üß† What's the Context API?

In React, the Context API is a built-in way to **share data across the component tree** without having to manually pass props down at every level (aka "prop drilling"). It‚Äôs like a global state, but scoped within your app where you need it.

Some examples where Context is useful:

* Managing user authentication (e.g. logged-in user info)
* Theme switching (light/dark)
* Language settings (i18n)
* Global app state in small/medium apps

## üß∞ What is `useContext`?

The `useContext` hook is the **modern, functional way to access context values** inside your functional components. Instead of using `<Context.Consumer>`, you can directly grab the value with one line using `useContext`.

### üîß Syntax

```jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

Here, `MyContext` is the object returned from `React.createContext()`.

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: How to Use Context with `useContext`

Let‚Äôs go through a complete example where we use Context to manage a simple theme toggle:

---

### üß± Step 1: Create the Context

```jsx
// ThemeContext.js
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

export const ThemeContext = createContext();

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

  const toggleTheme = () =>
    setTheme((prev) => (prev === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

* We create a context called `ThemeContext`.
* The provider wraps children and exposes the current theme and a method to toggle it.

---

### üß± Step 2: Use `ThemeProvider` at a Higher Level

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from './ThemeContext';
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Dashboard />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

We wrap our component tree with the `ThemeProvider` so that all nested components can access the theme context.

---

### üß± Step 3: Consume Context with `useContext`

```jsx
// Dashboard.js
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from './ThemeContext';

function Dashboard() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div style={{ background: theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333', color: theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff' }}>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* This is where `useContext` shines.
* Instead of drilling props, we directly grab `theme` and `toggleTheme` from context.

---

## üìù Why Use `useContext` Instead of Prop Drilling?

Consider this:

* Without context, a value (e.g. `theme`) needs to be passed through every intermediate component even if they don‚Äôt use it.
* With `useContext`, only the components that actually **need** the value subscribe to it. Cleaner, simpler, and more scalable.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When *Not* to Use Context

* Context is not a replacement for more powerful state management (like Redux, Zustand, etc.) when dealing with complex logic or large-scale applications.
* Avoid using context for **frequently updating values** like real-time data, as it will cause all consuming components to re-render every time the context value changes.

## üß© Summary

| Concept               | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `createContext()`     | Creates a new Context object                   |
| `<Provider value={}>` | Makes the value available to descendants       |
| `useContext()`        | Reads the current context value in a component |

Using `useContext` with Context API keeps your React components **clean, readable, and decoupled from unnecessary prop chains**. It‚Äôs a must-know pattern for modern React development.
