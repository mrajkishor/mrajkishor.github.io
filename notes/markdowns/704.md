### 🧠 Building Microfrontend Apps / **Shared State Management (Redux / Context)**

---

In microfrontend (MFE) architecture, managing **shared state** across independently built and deployed applications is one of the biggest technical challenges. Whether using **Redux**, **React Context**, or **event buses**, state needs to be handled in a way that ensures **consistency, isolation**, and **communication** between MFEs.

---

## 🔍 Why Shared State Matters in MFEs

* **Cross-cutting features** like auth, notifications, and theming need shared state.
* **Inter-MFE coordination** (e.g., cart updates from a product detail MFE).
* **Consistent user experience** across independently rendered UI fragments.

## 🏗️ Approaches to Shared State in Microfrontends

| Approach               | Scope                        | Pros                                | Cons                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Redux in Host**      | Global                       | Mature, predictable, easy dev tools | MFEs must access the host’s Redux store     |
| **Redux in MFEs**      | Isolated or synchronized     | Encapsulated logic per MFE          | Needs bridging logic for sync or middleware |
| **React Context**      | Local or lifted to host      | Simple, built-in                    | Not scalable for deep/nested updates        |
| **Custom Event Bus**   | Loosely coupled MFEs         | Decouples MFEs completely           | Hard to debug and test                      |
| **State from Backend** | Centralized and externalized | Ensures consistency across all MFEs | Adds network latency, server dependency     |

## ✅ Preferred: Host-Centralized Redux Store (Singleton Pattern)

```tsx
// shell/src/store/index.ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import authReducer from './authSlice';
import cartReducer from './cartSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { auth: authReducer, cart: cartReducer }
});
```

**Remote MFE usage:**

```tsx
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from 'shell/store';

<Provider store={store}>
  <RemoteComponent />
</Provider>
```

> 🔁 Redux Toolkit with `configureStore` is ideal for shared state across MFEs.

---

## 🧩 Shared Store via Module Federation

You can expose the Redux store from the host and **import** it in MFEs:

```ts
// host's webpack.config.js
exposes: {
  './store': './src/store',
}
```

```ts
// mfe's usage
const store = await import('host/store');
```

Ensure that `react-redux` and `redux` are marked as **shared singletons** in Module Federation:

```js
shared: {
  react: { singleton: true },
  'react-redux': { singleton: true },
  redux: { singleton: true },
}
```

---

## 📦 Redux per MFE (Isolated)

Each MFE manages its own Redux slice. Communication happens through:

* **Custom events**
* **Shared service layer**
* **Cross-MFE dispatch using exposed actions**

Pros:

* Easy to scale and test in isolation
* Local concerns remain local

Cons:

* Harder to coordinate across MFEs without orchestration logic

---

## 🔄 React Context

Use when:

* The state is **lightweight** (e.g., theme, language).
* Shared between **parent and child MFE** in the same DOM tree.

Context limitations:

* React Context can’t span across independently rendered apps (outside React boundaries).
* Not ideal for rapidly updating, deeply nested states.

---

## 🌐 Alternative: Custom Event Bus

Example:

```ts
// host/src/events.js
export const globalEventBus = new EventTarget();

// MFE emits
globalEventBus.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('cartUpdated', { detail: { count: 3 } }));

// Host listens
globalEventBus.addEventListener('cartUpdated', e => {
  store.dispatch(updateCart(e.detail));
});
```

> ✅ Works well for **loose coupling**, like analytics or UI events.

---

## 🧪 Example: Auth State Sharing

* `host` manages login state and user info
* `orders` MFE reads auth from shared Redux store or Context
* Prevents re-login or inconsistencies

## 🚧 Best Practices

| Tip                           | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 Use singletons             | Prevent multiple versions of `react`, `redux`, or `react-redux`            |
| 🧠 Centralize shared slices   | Use root store and inject remote slices dynamically if needed              |
| 🛡️ Protect shared state      | Don’t mutate global state directly from MFEs unless well-defined contracts |
| 📁 Use libraries/shared/state | In monorepos, keep state logic in shared libraries                         |
| 🧪 Test MFE interactions      | Write integration tests for communication scenarios                        |

## 📌 Summary

| Method               | Use Case                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Redux (shared store) | Complex state, cross-MFE coordination               |
| Redux (per MFE)      | Strong boundaries, independent features             |
| React Context        | Lightweight data, theming, shallow tree components  |
| Event Bus            | Loose coupling, one-off events, fallback            |
| Backend as state     | When consistency is critical and state must persist |

---

Shared state is the **nervous system of microfrontend apps**—get it wrong and you risk bugs, inconsistent UX, and hard-to-debug flows. For scalable, testable, and high-performance systems, centralizing via Redux in the host (with Module Federation support) is the most recommended pattern.
