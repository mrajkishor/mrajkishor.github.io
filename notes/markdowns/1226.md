# Notes: The Foundations – Logic and Proofs (Propositional Logic)

## 1. What Is Logic and Why It Matters
- **Logic** provides precise rules for interpreting and reasoning with statements.  
- It is central to:
  - Mathematics (building and verifying proofs).  
  - Computer science (program verification, circuit design, AI, programming languages).  
  - Many other fields where rigorous reasoning is required.  
- Proofs are essential because they confirm correctness, help adapt results to new situations, and form the backbone of mathematics and CS.

## 2. Propositions
- A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either **true (T)** or **false (F)**, not both.  
- Examples:  
  - ✔ “1 + 1 = 2” (True)  
  - ✘ “What time is it?” (Not a proposition, since it isn’t true/false)  
  - ✘ “x + 1 = 2” (Not a proposition until x is specified).  
- Propositional variables: typically denoted **p, q, r, …**

## 3. Logical Operators and Connectives

### a) Negation (¬p)
- “It is not the case that p.”  
- Truth reverses: if p = T → ¬p = F, and vice versa.  

### b) Conjunction (p ∧ q)
- Means **“p and q”**.  
- True only if *both* p and q are true.  

### c) Disjunction (p ∨ q)
- Means **“p or q”** (inclusive or).  
- True if *at least one* of p, q is true.  
- Note: Natural language “or” can be **inclusive** (either or both) or **exclusive** (exactly one, not both).  

### d) Exclusive Or (p ⊕ q)
- True if **exactly one** of p, q is true.  
- False if both are true or both are false.  

### e) Conditional (p → q)
- Means **“if p, then q”**.  
- False only if p = T and q = F.  
- Terminology:
  - p = hypothesis / antecedent / premise  
  - q = conclusion / consequence  
- Equivalent forms: “p implies q”, “q if p”, “p only if q”.  

#### Related:
- **Converse:** q → p  
- **Inverse:** ¬p → ¬q  
- **Contrapositive:** ¬q → ¬p (logically equivalent to p → q).  

### f) Biconditional (p ↔ q)
- Means **“p if and only if q” (iff)**.  
- True when p and q have the same truth value.  
- Equivalent to (p → q) ∧ (q → p).

## 4. Truth Tables
- Used to evaluate the truth value of compound propositions for all possible truth values of their components.  
- Example: (p ∨ ¬q) → (p ∧ q) evaluated systematically with a table.  

---

## 5. Precedence Rules
To reduce parentheses, logical operators have precedence (like arithmetic operators):  
1. ¬ (highest)  
2. ∧  
3. ∨  
4. →  
5. ↔ (lowest)  

---

## 6. Logic and Computer Science
- Truth values can be mapped to **bits** (1 = True, 0 = False).  
- Logical operations correspond to **bitwise operations** (AND, OR, XOR).  
- Useful in circuit design, programming, and binary data manipulation.

## 7. Applications of Propositional Logic
1. **Translating English into Logic**  
   - Example:  
     - “You can access the Internet from campus only if you are a CS major or not a freshman.”  
     - a → (c ∨ ¬f)  
2. **System Specifications**  
   - Converting natural language requirements into precise logical expressions helps check for consistency.  
   - Example:  
     - “Automated reply cannot be sent when the file system is full” → q → ¬p.  
3. **Boolean Searches**  
   - Search engines and databases use AND, OR, NOT operators.

✅ This section sets the groundwork for understanding **proofs**, **inference rules**, and **predicate logic** (covered later in the chapter).
