### 🔹 Topic: **Divide and Conquer Techniques**

## 🔹 1. What is Divide and Conquer?

**Divide and Conquer** is a fundamental algorithm design paradigm where a problem is:

1. **Divided** into smaller subproblems of the same type
2. **Conquered** by solving the subproblems recursively
3. **Combined** to form the solution to the original problem

This approach is ideal for **recursive problems**, especially those involving sorting, searching, and optimization.

---

## 🔹 2. Standard Steps

1. **Divide** the problem into subproblems (usually of size `n/2`)
2. **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively
3. **Combine** the results of the subproblems to get the final solution

---

## 🔹 3. Time Complexity Framework

If a problem of size `n` is divided into `a` subproblems each of size `n/b`, and combining takes `f(n)` time, the recurrence is:

```
T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)
```

This is solved using the **Master Theorem**.

---

### 🔹 Master Theorem (GATE-focused):

For `T(n) = aT(n/b) + Θ(n^d)`:

* **Case 1**: If `a < b^d` → `T(n) = Θ(n^d)`
* **Case 2**: If `a = b^d` → `T(n) = Θ(n^d log n)`
* **Case 3**: If `a > b^d` → `T(n) = Θ(n^log_b a)`

## 🔹 4. Classic Divide and Conquer Sorting Algorithms

### ✅ **Mergesort**

* **Divide**: Split array into two halves
* **Conquer**: Recursively sort both halves
* **Combine**: Merge two sorted halves

| Property   | Value      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Time       | O(n log n) |
| Space      | O(n)       |
| Stable     | ✅ Yes      |
| Worst Case | O(n log n) |

**Recurrence**: `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)` → **O(n log n)**

---

### ✅ **Quicksort**

* **Divide**: Choose a pivot and partition the array
* **Conquer**: Recursively sort the partitions
* **Combine**: Already sorted via partitioning (no explicit merge)

| Property        | Value      |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Time (Best/Avg) | O(n log n) |
| Time (Worst)    | O(n²)      |
| Space           | O(log n)   |
| Stable          | ❌ No       |
| In-place        | ✅ Yes      |

**Recurrence** (Best/Average): `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)` → O(n log n)
**Worst Case** (e.g., sorted input): `T(n) = T(n−1) + O(n)` → O(n²)

| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Binary Search                    | Divide array in half recursively             | O(log n)   |
| Matrix Multiplication (Strassen) | Divide matrices into submatrices             | O(n^2.81)  |
| Closest Pair of Points (2D)      | Recursively solve in halves + merge step     | O(n log n) |
| Maximum Subarray (Kadane alt.)   | Divide, conquer left/right, combine crossing | O(n log n) |

* Sometimes leads to **function call overhead**
* Not always optimal for small inputs

## ✅ Final Tips for GATE

* **Know Master Theorem** and be able to identify `a`, `b`, `f(n)`
* **Mergesort is always O(n log n)** — safe choice in complexity-based MCQs
* **Quicksort is faster in practice** but has worst-case O(n²)
* Be ready to **trace recursive calls** in divide and conquer problems
* GATE may ask you to write **recurrence relations** for code
