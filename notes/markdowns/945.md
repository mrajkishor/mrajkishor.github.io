### 🔸 Amazon EC2 – Overview

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is one of the core services offered by AWS and is often the first step in cloud computing for many developers and businesses. It's essentially a service that lets you rent virtual machines in the cloud.

When we say **"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)"**, it means that AWS provides the virtual hardware, and you manage the software (like OS, applications, etc.) just like you would on a physical server.

#### Key Capabilities of EC2:

* 🖥 **Renting Virtual Machines**: You can launch Linux or Windows servers as needed.
* 💽 **Storage Options**: Attach virtual hard drives (like **EBS**) to store your data.
* 🔁 **Load Balancing**: Use **ELB** (Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
* 📈 **Auto Scaling**: Automatically increase or decrease the number of instances using **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** based on demand.

Understanding EC2 is fundamental because it’s the backbone of how many cloud applications run in a scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient way.

### 🔧 EC2 Sizing & Configuration Options

When launching an EC2 instance, you can customize it based on your needs:

1. **Operating System (OS)**:

   * Choose from Linux, Windows, or even macOS (on specific instance types).

2. **Compute Power (CPU)**:

   * Decide how many virtual CPUs (vCPUs) and what level of performance (e.g., burstable vs. dedicated).

3. **Memory (RAM)**:

   * Allocate appropriate RAM based on your application’s requirements.

4. **Storage Options**:

   * 🧩 **EBS & EFS** (Elastic Block & File Storage): Network-attached, persistent storage.
   * 💾 **Instance Store**: Ephemeral storage physically attached to the host machine (lost on stop/terminate).

5. **Networking**:

   * Choose network card type, speed, and whether your instance should have a **Public IP**.

6. **Security Groups** (Firewall):

   * Acts like a firewall — define which traffic (ports/IPs) is allowed to reach your instance.

7. **User Data Script**:

   * Automate tasks at instance launch using **EC2 User Data** (explained below).

### ⚙️ EC2 User Data

EC2 provides a powerful feature to **automate initialization** using a script called **User Data**.

#### What is EC2 User Data?

It’s a shell script (Linux) or PowerShell script (Windows) you can provide during the launch of an instance.

#### Key Points:

* 🛠 **Bootstrapping**: The process of running commands automatically when the instance first starts.
* 🔁 **Runs Only Once**: The script executes only the first time the instance boots after creation.
* ⚙️ **Automates Setup**:

  * Install updates
  * Install packages/software (e.g., Apache, Node.js)
  * Download config files or code from the internet
  * Set environment variables or cron jobs
* 🔐 **Runs as Root**: The script has root access, so it can perform system-level changes.

This is extremely useful when you want to spin up multiple servers with the same setup or when you're deploying environments on-the-fly without manual intervention.
