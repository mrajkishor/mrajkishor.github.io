# **Deadlock Handling in Concurrency Control in DBMS**

Concurrency in a Database Management System (DBMS) allows multiple transactions to execute simultaneously. While this improves efficiency, it can sometimes result in **deadlocks**—a situation where two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources, and none of them can proceed.

In this blog, we will explore the concept of deadlocks, how they occur, and various techniques for handling them effectively in a DBMS.

## **What is a Deadlock?**

A deadlock is a situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for resources held by each other. It prevents the involved transactions from making progress, leading to a standstill.

### **Example of Deadlock:**
Consider two transactions, T1 and T2:
- T1 locks Resource A and requests Resource B.
- T2 locks Resource B and requests Resource A.

Neither T1 nor T2 can proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. This creates a circular dependency, leading to a deadlock.

## **Conditions for Deadlock**

Deadlocks occur when the following four conditions are met simultaneously:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one transaction can hold a resource at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A transaction holding one resource is waiting for additional resources held by other transactions.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a transaction.
4. **Circular Wait**: A closed chain of transactions exists where each transaction waits for a resource held by the next transaction in the chain.

## **Techniques for Deadlock Handling**

Deadlock handling can be categorized into three main strategies:
1. **Deadlock Prevention**
2. **Deadlock Detection and Recovery**
3. **Deadlock Avoidance**

### 1. **Deadlock Prevention**

Deadlock prevention aims to eliminate one or more of the necessary conditions for a deadlock.

#### **Techniques for Deadlock Prevention:**

1. **Resource Ordering**:
   - Assign a unique priority to each resource.
   - Transactions must request resources in increasing order of priority.
   - **Example**: If Resource A has a lower priority than Resource B, transactions must always request A before B.

2. **Preemptive Resource Allocation**:
   - If a transaction holding a resource requests another, the held resources can be preempted and assigned to another transaction.
   - **Example**: If T1 holds Resource A but needs Resource B held by T2, the DBMS can roll back T1 and free Resource A.

3. **Disabling Hold and Wait**:
   - Ensure that a transaction requests all required resources at once.
   - If all resources are unavailable, the transaction waits without holding any resource.
   - **Drawback**: This can lead to resource underutilization.

#### **Example of Deadlock Prevention:**
Transactions T1 and T2 need Resources A and B:
- Assign priorities: A < B.
- Enforce the rule: Always request A before B.
- This eliminates circular wait and prevents deadlock.

### 2. **Deadlock Detection and Recovery**

When the system does not prevent deadlocks, it must detect and resolve them.

#### **Deadlock Detection Mechanism**:
- The DBMS uses a **Wait-For Graph (WFG)**:
  - Nodes represent transactions.
  - Edges represent transactions waiting for resources held by others.
  - A cycle in the graph indicates a deadlock.

#### **Recovery Techniques**:
1. **Transaction Rollback**:
   - Abort one or more transactions to break the deadlock.
   - Choose a victim based on factors like transaction age, resource usage, and priority.

2. **Timeouts**:
   - Set a timeout for transactions.
   - If a transaction exceeds its timeout, it is aborted and resources are released.

#### **Example of Deadlock Detection and Recovery**:
- **Transactions**: T1 → waits for Resource B, T2 → waits for Resource A.
- **Wait-For Graph**:
  - T1 → T2 → T1 (Cycle detected).
- **Resolution**: Roll back T1, releasing Resource A. T2 can now proceed.

### 3. **Deadlock Avoidance**

Deadlock avoidance dynamically checks transactions' resource requests and ensures that the system never enters an unsafe state.

#### **Technique: Banker's Algorithm**
1. Maintain information about available, allocated, and maximum required resources.
2. A transaction’s resource request is granted only if it leaves the system in a safe state.

#### **Example of Deadlock Avoidance:**
- **Initial State**:
  - Available: A = 3, B = 2
  - T1: Max (A = 4, B = 2), Allocated (A = 2, B = 1)
  - T2: Max (A = 3, B = 2), Allocated (A = 1, B = 1)

- **T1 Requests**: A = 1, B = 1
  - After allocation, the system checks if resources are sufficient for both T1 and T2 to complete.
  - If yes, the request is granted; otherwise, it is delayed.

## **Deadlock Handling in SQL**

Most DBMSs like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle implement deadlock detection and resolution automatically.

### **Example in MySQL**:
- **Transaction T1**:
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  LOCK TABLE ResourceA WRITE;
  -- Operations on ResourceA
  ```
- **Transaction T2**:
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  LOCK TABLE ResourceB WRITE;
  -- Operations on ResourceB
  ```

If T1 requests `ResourceB` and T2 requests `ResourceA`, MySQL detects the deadlock and aborts one transaction.

## **Deadlock Example in E-Commerce**

### **Scenario**:
1. Transaction T1 updates **Inventory** for Product A and requests a lock on **Order Table**.
2. Transaction T2 updates **Order Table** for Product A and requests a lock on **Inventory**.

#### **Deadlock**:
- T1 → holds Inventory → waits for Order Table.
- T2 → holds Order Table → waits for Inventory.
- Deadlock occurs.

#### **Resolution**:
1. Detect the deadlock using a Wait-For Graph.
2. Rollback T2, allowing T1 to complete.

## **Comparison of Techniques**

| **Method**           | **Advantages**                          | **Disadvantages**                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Prevention**        | Ensures no deadlocks occur.             | Can lead to resource underutilization.   |
| **Detection**         | Efficient in dynamic systems.           | Requires extra overhead for detection.   |
| **Avoidance**         | Prevents deadlocks dynamically.         | Requires precise resource information.   |

## **Conclusion**

Deadlocks are a critical challenge in DBMS concurrency control, but they can be effectively managed using prevention, detection, and avoidance techniques. While prevention ensures that deadlocks never occur, detection and recovery deal with deadlocks after they arise, and avoidance proactively ensures the system remains in a safe state.

Understanding these techniques helps database administrators and developers design robust systems that maintain data integrity and ensure smooth concurrent operations.
