### 📘 Redis: Data Types Overview

Redis is more than a simple key-value store — it supports a **rich set of data types** that enable developers to model complex real-time use cases efficiently. Each key in Redis can be associated with a value of one of several data structures.

---

### 🔹 1. **String**

* **Most basic type** in Redis.
* Binary-safe, can store text, numbers, or serialized objects.

#### ✅ Common Use Cases:

* Caching objects
* Counter increments
* Storing JWT tokens or session data

#### 🔧 Commands:

```bash
SET key "value"
GET key
INCR page_views
DECR stock_count
```

---

### 🔹 2. **List**

* Ordered collection of **strings**.
* Supports operations from both ends: **left (LPUSH)** and **right (RPUSH)**.

#### ✅ Common Use Cases:

* Message queues (FIFO/LIFO)
* Recent activity logs

#### 🔧 Commands:

```bash
LPUSH tasks "task1"
RPUSH tasks "task2"
LPOP tasks
RPOP tasks
LRANGE tasks 0 -1
```

---

### 🔹 3. **Set**

* Unordered collection of **unique strings** (no duplicates).
* Supports set operations like **union, intersection, and difference**.

#### ✅ Common Use Cases:

* Track unique users
* Tags and categories
* Friend recommendations

#### 🔧 Commands:

```bash
SADD users "user1"
SREM users "user2"
SISMEMBER users "user3"
SUNION set1 set2
```

---

### 🔹 4. **Sorted Set (ZSET)**

* Similar to Set but each element has a **score**, and elements are ordered by score.
* Ideal for **ranking and leaderboard** systems.

#### ✅ Common Use Cases:

* Leaderboards
* Ranking systems
* Time-series data

#### 🔧 Commands:

```bash
ZADD leaderboard 100 "player1"
ZADD leaderboard 150 "player2"
ZRANGE leaderboard 0 -1 WITHSCORES
ZREVRANK leaderboard "player1"
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Hash**

* Store **field-value pairs** under one key, like a dictionary or map.
* Used to model objects like users, products, etc.

#### ✅ Common Use Cases:

* Object-like storage (e.g., user profile)
* Configuration settings

#### 🔧 Commands:

```bash
HSET user:101 name "Alice" age "30"
HGET user:101 name
HGETALL user:101
```

---

### 🔹 6. **Bitmap**

* Compact data type for **bit-level operations**.
* Efficient for representing binary flags (e.g., true/false, yes/no).

#### ✅ Common Use Cases:

* Feature flags
* User activity tracking (e.g., login on specific days)

#### 🔧 Commands:

```bash
SETBIT daily:login:2025-06-14 101 1
GETBIT daily:login:2025-06-14 101
BITCOUNT daily:login:2025-06-14
```

---

### 🔹 7. **HyperLogLog**

* Probabilistic data structure used for **approximate cardinality counting** (i.e., counting unique items).
* Very memory-efficient (12 KB).

#### ✅ Common Use Cases:

* Counting unique visitors
* Tracking unique IPs or devices

#### 🔧 Commands:

```bash
PFADD unique_visitors user1 user2 user3
PFCOUNT unique_visitors
```

---

### 🔹 8. **Streams**

* Append-only log data structure.
* Supports **consumer groups**, **event IDs**, and **durable message queues**.

#### ✅ Common Use Cases:

* Event sourcing
* Real-time logs
* Message queue replacement

#### 🔧 Commands:

```bash
XADD mystream * name "Alice" action "login"
XRANGE mystream - +
XREAD COUNT 2 STREAMS mystream 0
```

| Data Type   | Ordered? | Unique Elements? | Best Use Case                       |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| String      | ✖️       | ✖️               | Cache, counters                     |
| List        | ✔️       | ✖️               | Queues, logs                        |
| Set         | ✖️       | ✔️               | Unique tags, user sets              |
| Sorted Set  | ✔️       | ✔️               | Leaderboards, rankings              |
| Hash        | ✖️       | ✖️               | Object representation               |
| Bitmap      | ✖️       | N/A              | Feature flags, activity tracking    |
| HyperLogLog | ✖️       | ✖️ (approximate) | Unique user/device counts           |
| Stream      | ✔️       | ✖️               | Message queues, real-time pipelines |

### ✅ Final Thoughts

Redis’s diverse set of data types allows developers to model complex workflows — from caching and queues to analytics and messaging — all with high performance and minimal overhead.
