# **Advanced Patterns: Debouncing, Polling, and Sequencing**

As your application grows more interactive — with live search, background refreshes, and complex multi-step workflows — you’ll quickly need more than just basic sagas.

At that point, understanding advanced Redux-Saga patterns becomes critical. These aren’t "nice to haves" — they're **mandatory** if you want your code to stay fast, resilient, and scalable in real-world applications.

Let’s dive into **three advanced async control patterns** used by experienced developers at scale: **debouncing**, **polling**, and **sequencing**.

---

## 🧠 Pattern 1: Debouncing with Redux-Saga

### 📖 What is Debouncing?

Debouncing means:

> "Wait until the user stops firing actions for a short time, then react."

This is perfect for live search inputs or autosave flows, where you don’t want to hit the server on **every keystroke**.

---

### 🛠 Example: Debounced Search Bar

```tsx
import { debounce, put, call } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { searchQueryAPI } from "../api";

function* handleSearch(action) {
  const results = yield call(searchQueryAPI, action.payload);
  yield put({ type: "SEARCH_SUCCESS", payload: results });
}

export function* watchSearch() {
  yield debounce(500, "SEARCH_INPUT_CHANGED", handleSearch);
}
```

### ✅ Key Points:

* `debounce(delay, actionType, saga)` waits until there's a **500ms pause** between inputs before calling `handleSearch`
* If the user types continuously, the saga won’t fire — only after the typing stops

### 🔥 Real Use Cases:

* Live search suggestions
* Autosave while filling a form
* Real-time filtering

---

## 🔁 Pattern 2: Polling with Redux-Saga

### 📖 What is Polling?

Polling means:

> "Run a saga repeatedly at a fixed interval, usually to fetch fresh data."

Think of:

* Chat messages
* Stock tickers
* Health check dashboards

---

### 🛠 Example: Polling Notifications Every 10 Seconds

```ts
import { call, put, delay, cancelled, take, fork, cancel } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { fetchNotifications } from "../api";

function* pollNotifications() {
  try {
    while (true) {
      const data = yield call(fetchNotifications);
      yield put({ type: "NOTIFICATIONS_RECEIVED", payload: data });
      yield delay(10000); // wait 10s before polling again
    }
  } finally {
    if (yield cancelled()) {
      console.log("Polling cancelled");
    }
  }
}

function* watchPollingStart() {
  while (true) {
    yield take("START_POLLING");
    const task = yield fork(pollNotifications);

    yield take("STOP_POLLING");
    yield cancel(task); // stop polling loop
  }
}
```

### ✅ What This Gives You:

* Controlled polling with proper cancel support
* Doesn’t flood your backend
* Can be stopped cleanly when the user navigates away or logs out

---

## 🧭 Pattern 3: Sequencing with Redux-Saga

### 📖 What is Sequencing?

Sequencing means:

> "Execute a series of dependent tasks one after another in a strict order."

Think of:

* Step-by-step onboarding
* Order confirmation flows
* Multi-step form validation & submission

---

### 🛠 Example: User Registration Flow

```ts
function* registerUserSaga(action) {
  try {
    const user = yield call(api.register, action.payload);
    yield put({ type: "REGISTER_SUCCESS", payload: user });

    const token = yield call(api.login, {
      email: action.payload.email,
      password: action.payload.password,
    });
    yield put({ type: "LOGIN_SUCCESS", payload: token });

    yield put({ type: "FETCH_USER_DATA_REQUEST" });
  } catch (err) {
    yield put({ type: "REGISTRATION_FAILED", error: err.message });
  }
}
```

### ✅ Why This Works:

* You ensure registration → login → data load happens **in strict sequence**
* If one step fails, the rest won’t run
* Keeps side effects in a single clean flow

---

## 🔥 Extra: Combine Patterns

Real apps often use **multiple patterns together**:

🔁 **Polling with cancelation**
🔍 **Debounced input + sequencing for submission**
📦 **Batching async tasks with delays or retries**

---

## 🧠 Enterprise-Level Insights

| Pattern    | Tool Used                     | Typical Use Case                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Debouncing | `debounce(delay, type, saga)` | Search bars, autosave, live filters   |
| Polling    | `while(true)`, `delay()`      | Notifications, dashboard refreshes    |
| Sequencing | `call()` chain inside saga    | Step-by-step flows, onboarding, forms |

* Always **cancel polling** when the user exits a page or logs out
* Wrap sequencing in `try/catch` so you can rollback if a step fails
* With debounce, **show loading indicators** after the delay for smoother UX

---

## ✅ Summary

| Pattern    | What It Solves                              | Key Tools                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Debouncing | Avoid spamming APIs on rapid input          | `debounce()`                         |
| Polling    | Keep data fresh without user interaction    | `while(true)`, `delay()`, `cancel()` |
| Sequencing | Ensures tasks run in order, not in parallel | `call()`, `try/catch`                |

These patterns are not just useful — they are **necessary** when building scalable async flows at Enterprise level or in any fast-moving product.

---

Let’s level up with two high-impact patterns used heavily in **Enterprise-scale apps**:


# 🚀 Redux-Saga Advanced Patterns

## 🧱 Exponential Backoff (Polling Resilience)

## ⚡️ Throttling Using Action Channels (Controlled Concurrency)

---

## 🔁 Exponential Backoff with Polling

### ❓Why It Matters

When polling fails due to server errors or rate limits, blindly retrying at the same interval can overload the server or waste network.
**Exponential backoff** solves this by **waiting longer between retries** — commonly used in systems like AWS, Google Cloud, etc.

---

### 🧠 Core Idea

Each time the poll fails, wait:

```
2^1 sec → 2^2 sec → 2^3 sec → ... up to a max
```

This gives the server time to recover, and avoids hammering it continuously.

---

### 🛠 Example Implementation

```ts
import { call, put, delay } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { fetchData } from "../api";

function* pollWithBackoff() {
  let attempt = 0;
  const maxDelay = 30000; // 30s cap

  while (true) {
    try {
      const result = yield call(fetchData);
      yield put({ type: "FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: result });

      attempt = 0; // reset on success
      yield delay(10000); // poll interval
    } catch (err) {
      attempt += 1;

      // Exponential backoff with a cap
      const backoffTime = Math.min(2 ** attempt * 1000, maxDelay);
      yield put({ type: "FETCH_RETRY_BACKOFF", delay: backoffTime });

      yield delay(backoffTime);
    }
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ Enterprise Insight

* Backoff + jitter (randomness) is also common in real systems to avoid retry bursts.
* You can use \[`Math.random()`] to introduce a small randomness into `backoffTime`.

---

## ⚡ Throttling with Action Channels

### ❓Why It Matters

If your app dispatches **bursts of actions** (e.g., scroll, mouse move, resize, logs), you don’t want to process all of them — only a few per second.

Throttling ensures only **one action per X ms** is handled, the rest are **skipped**.

---

### 📦 What’s an Action Channel?

A channel is like a **buffered queue** where you can control how actions are consumed.

---

### 🛠 Saga Throttle with Action Channel

```ts
import { actionChannel, take, call, delay } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { handleScrollUpdate } from "../api";

function* throttleScrollEvents() {
  const channel = yield actionChannel("SCROLL_UPDATE");

  while (true) {
    const action = yield take(channel);
    yield call(handleScrollUpdate, action.payload);
    yield delay(1000); // throttle: 1 event per sec
  }
}
```

---

### 🧠 What's Going On Here?

* `actionChannel("SCROLL_UPDATE")`: creates a queue for this action
* `take(channel)`: consumes actions **one by one**
* `delay(1000)`: waits before consuming the next — i.e., **throttling**

This is more powerful than `takeLatest` or `debounce` because it gives:

* Explicit control over timing
* Full buffer control (you can drop old actions, collapse, etc.)

---

### 🔥 Use Cases

* Scroll event throttling
* Analytics logging (don't send every click)
* Button spamming
* Complex form validation (throttle field validation)

---

## ✅ Summary

| Pattern                     | Use Case                         | Key Tool                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Exponential Backoff**     | Retry API without spamming       | `delay() + Math.pow`             |
| **Action Channel Throttle** | Control bursty user interactions | `actionChannel`, `take`, `delay` |

---

Let's go even deeper into:

* `buffers.sliding()` or `buffers.dropping()` for action queue control
* Combining backoff + cancel logic
* Testing sagas with exponential delay


# 🔬 Redux-Saga Advanced Techniques

## ✅ `buffers.sliding()` & `buffers.dropping()`

## 🔁 Combining Backoff + Cancel Logic

## 🧪 Testing Exponential Delay Logic

---

## 1️⃣ `buffers.sliding()` and `buffers.dropping()` — Action Queue Control

### 📌 Problem

You’re using `actionChannel()` to throttle or serialize action handling, but what happens when **actions come in faster than you can process them?** Do you:

* Buffer them all?
* Drop some?
* Replace old ones with newer ones?

This is where `redux-saga`'s **custom buffers** come in.

---

### 🧠 Buffer Strategies

| Buffer Type           | What It Does                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `buffers.fixed(n)`    | Keeps up to `n` actions, blocks if full                             |
| `buffers.dropping(n)` | Drops **newest** actions if full — good when new data is disposable |
| `buffers.sliding(n)`  | Drops **oldest** actions if full — keeps newest ones                |
| `buffers.expanding()` | Unlimited queue (careful with memory!)                              |

---

### 🔧 Example: Dropping Old Actions (e.g., telemetry)

```ts
import { buffers, actionChannel, take } from "redux-saga/effects";

function* logTelemetry() {
  const chan = yield actionChannel("LOG_TELEMETRY", buffers.dropping(10));

  while (true) {
    const action = yield take(chan);
    yield call(api.sendTelemetry, action.payload);
  }
}
```

* You’re only interested in the **latest 10 events**
* If more come in while you’re busy, they’ll be dropped
* Prevents telemetry overload

---

### 🔧 Example: Sliding Buffer for Scroll Events

```ts
const chan = yield actionChannel("SCROLL_EVENT", buffers.sliding(1));
```

* Only the **latest scroll** is kept
* Older unprocessed ones are discarded
* Great for **real-time UIs** where only the current state matters

---

## 2️⃣ Combining Exponential Backoff + Cancel Logic

### 📌 Problem

You want to:

* Retry failed requests **intelligently** (exponential backoff)
* But also **cancel** if the user navigates away or triggers a manual cancel

---

### 🔧 Full Pattern Example

```ts
import { take, call, delay, race, put, fork, cancel, cancelled } from "redux-saga/effects";

function* pollWithBackoffAndCancel() {
  let attempt = 0;

  try {
    while (true) {
      try {
        const result = yield call(api.fetchData);
        yield put({ type: "FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: result });
        attempt = 0;
        yield delay(10000);
      } catch (err) {
        attempt++;
        const backoff = Math.min(2 ** attempt * 1000, 30000);
        yield put({ type: "FETCH_RETRY_BACKOFF", delay: backoff });
        yield delay(backoff);
      }
    }
  } finally {
    if (yield cancelled()) {
      console.log("Polling canceled by user");
    }
  }
}

function* watchPollingFlow() {
  while (true) {
    yield take("START_POLLING");
    const task = yield fork(pollWithBackoffAndCancel);
    yield take("STOP_POLLING");
    yield cancel(task);
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ Key Behaviors:

* Cancels polling on `"STOP_POLLING"`
* Applies backoff if failures stack up
* Logs or notifies when polling is canceled

> This exact pattern is used in dashboards, file watchers, or even auto-refreshing data.

---

## 3️⃣ 🧪 Testing Sagas with Exponential Delay Logic

Let’s say we want to test a saga that retries on failure using exponential backoff.

---

### 👇 Testable Saga

```ts
function* retryWithBackoffSaga() {
  let attempts = 0;
  while (true) {
    try {
      const result = yield call(api.fetchData);
      yield put({ type: "FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: result });
      break;
    } catch (err) {
      attempts++;
      const delayMs = Math.min(2 ** attempts * 1000, 16000);
      yield delay(delayMs);
    }
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ Test It

```ts
import { call, put, delay } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { retryWithBackoffSaga } from "../sagas";
import { fetchData } from "../api";

test("exponential backoff retries", () => {
  const gen = retryWithBackoffSaga();

  // First attempt fails
  expect(gen.next().value).toEqual(call(fetchData));
  const error1 = new Error("fail 1");
  expect(gen.throw(error1).value).toEqual(delay(2000)); // 2^1 * 1000

  // Second attempt fails
  expect(gen.next().value).toEqual(call(fetchData));
  const error2 = new Error("fail 2");
  expect(gen.throw(error2).value).toEqual(delay(4000)); // 2^2 * 1000

  // Third succeeds
  expect(gen.next().value).toEqual(call(fetchData));
  const data = { name: "Done" };
  expect(gen.next(data).value).toEqual(put({ type: "FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: data }));

  // Saga ends
  expect(gen.next().done).toBe(true);
});
```

---

## More Advanced Concepts: 

Let’s begin with one of the most **powerful and underrated tools** in Redux-Saga:

# 🌐 React / Redux / Redux-Saga / `eventChannel`

## 📡 Handling WebSockets, Streams, and External Events

---

### ❓ What is `eventChannel`?

When side effects come from **outside your app** — like WebSockets, Firebase listeners, DOM events — you can't handle them with plain `take` or `takeEvery`.

That’s where `eventChannel()` comes in. It lets you **convert any callback-based or event-driven source into a Saga-friendly stream**.

---

### 🧠 Mental Model

* Think of `eventChannel` as a bridge between **external events** and **your sagas**.
* You subscribe to events (e.g., socket.on).
* Redux-Saga **wraps them in a stream** you can `take()` from like Redux actions.

---

## 🔧 Basic Usage: WebSocket Listener

Let’s say you have a WebSocket that sends messages like this:

```ts
socket.on("message", (msg) => { ... });
```

You want to react to these inside your saga — e.g., update chat, add notifications, etc.

---

### 🛠 Step-by-Step Code

```ts
import { eventChannel } from "redux-saga";
import { call, take, put, fork, cancel } from "redux-saga/effects";

// 1️⃣ Create the eventChannel from WebSocket
function createSocketChannel(socket) {
  return eventChannel((emit) => {
    const messageHandler = (event) => {
      emit({ type: "NEW_MESSAGE", payload: event });
    };

    const errorHandler = (err) => {
      emit(new Error(err));
    };

    socket.on("message", messageHandler);
    socket.on("error", errorHandler);

    // 2️⃣ Return unsubscribe logic
    return () => {
      socket.off("message", messageHandler);
      socket.off("error", errorHandler);
    };
  });
}
```

---

### 📡 Saga That Listens to Socket Events

```ts
function* watchSocket(socket) {
  const socketChannel = yield call(createSocketChannel, socket);

  try {
    while (true) {
      const action = yield take(socketChannel); // like take from Redux
      yield put(action); // dispatch to Redux
    }
  } catch (err) {
    yield put({ type: "SOCKET_ERROR", error: err.message });
  } finally {
    socketChannel.close(); // cleanup
  }
}
```

---

### 📦 Starting and Stopping the Listener

```ts
function* rootSaga() {
  yield take("SOCKET_CONNECT");

  const socket = yield call(connectSocket);
  const task = yield fork(watchSocket, socket);

  yield take("SOCKET_DISCONNECT");
  yield cancel(task);
}
```

---

### ✅ Real Use Cases

| Use Case                 | Event Source              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Chat messages            | WebSocket `on('msg')`     |
| Firebase live updates    | `onSnapshot()`            |
| DOM Events (resize, key) | `window.addEventListener` |
| BLE or IoT Device events | Native callbacks          |

---

### 🧼 Clean Exit: Why `eventChannel()` Is Better

* Graceful cleanup via the unsubscribe function
* Can `take()` from it just like any Redux action
* Can `cancel()` the saga anytime — perfect for **route changes** or **auth expiration**

---

### 🧠 Enterprise Engineering Insight

* This pattern gives you **non-Redux event control** inside your Redux-Saga world
* Abstracts async listeners as synchronous-style `take()` calls
* Used in Slack (chat), Zoom (live status), Uber (driver tracking)

---

### ✅ Summary

| Concept          | Role                                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `eventChannel()` | Creates a saga-readable stream from external events |
| `emit()`         | Emits events inside the channel (like actions)      |
| `take(channel)`  | Consumes emitted events inside your saga            |
| `cancel(task)`   | Stops the watcher saga when needed (e.g., logout)   |

---

You now know how to **bridge outside world events into Redux-Saga**, cleanly and predictably.

---

## 👉 **Cleanup Patterns: Cancelling Sagas on Route Change** (essential for React-Router + Sagas)

Let’s now cover something **essential in real-world apps**:

## ⚙️ Lifecycle Cleanup: Cancelling Background Tasks on Route Change

---

### ❓ Why Is This Important?

Imagine this:

* A user opens a product page → triggers a background saga (e.g., fetch, poll, upload)
* Then **navigates away quickly**
* The saga still runs in the background… maybe even mutates state after unmount
  ❌ **Memory leaks**
  ❌ **Stale state updates**
  ❌ **Race conditions**

This is **very common** unless you **cancel sagas on route change**.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Use Cases

| Situation                               | Cleanup Required? | Why                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Upload in progress, user navigates away | ✅                 | Save bandwidth, avoid race condition |
| Polling dashboard, route changes        | ✅                 | Stop unnecessary API calls           |
| Socket listener on `/chat`              | ✅                 | Avoid duplicate sockets              |

---

## 💡 Core Tools: `take`, `race`, `cancel`, `fork`

The idea is to:

1. **Start a saga** (e.g., polling, upload, listener)
2. **Watch for route change or cancel action**
3. **Cancel the running task** cleanly

---

## 🛠 Pattern: Cancel Saga on Location Change

Here’s a React-Router-aware cleanup pattern:

### 🔧 Saga: `watchPollingWithCancel`

```ts
import { take, call, fork, cancel, race } from "redux-saga/effects";

function* pollProduct(productId) {
  while (true) {
    const data = yield call(api.fetchProduct, productId);
    yield put({ type: "PRODUCT_UPDATED", payload: data });
    yield delay(5000);
  }
}

function* watchProductPageFlow() {
  while (true) {
    const { payload } = yield take("OPEN_PRODUCT_PAGE");

    const task = yield fork(pollProduct, payload.id);

    // Wait for navigation away
    yield take("LOCATION_CHANGE"); // or use react-router event

    yield cancel(task); // cancel background polling
  }
}
```

---

### 🔁 Bonus: Use `race` for cancel-or-complete

```ts
function* uploadFileFlow(action) {
  const task = yield fork(handleUpload, action.payload);

  const { cancelUpload } = yield race({
    cancelUpload: take("UPLOAD_CANCELLED"),
    success: take("UPLOAD_SUCCESS"),
  });

  if (cancelUpload) {
    yield cancel(task);
    yield put({ type: "UPLOAD_ABORTED" });
  }
}
```

---

## 📦 Plug Into Route Lifecycle (React Router v6+)

If you're using **React Router v6**, you can:

* Use `useLocation()` to trigger saga state resets
* Dispatch a `LOCATION_CHANGE` action in a `<Layout>` component

Or you can bridge the router using:

```ts
history.listen((location) => {
  store.dispatch({ type: "LOCATION_CHANGE", payload: location });
});
```

---

### ✅ Summary

| Concept           | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `cancel(task)`    | Stop background sagas                      |
| `fork()`          | Run task in non-blocking mode              |
| `race()`          | Compete between finish and cancel triggers |
| `LOCATION_CHANGE` | Acts as a universal cleanup signal         |

Up Next:
🔐 **Auth Workflows with Saga** — Login, Token Refresh, and Auto-Logout

Now let’s dive into something **critical at any Enterprise-level app**:
handling **authentication workflows** with Redux-Saga.

## Authentication Workflows: Login, Token Refresh & Auto Logout

---

### ❓ Why Do You Need a Saga for Auth?

Authentication isn’t just about logging in. It involves:

* Handling **token expiration**
* Refreshing tokens in the background
* Cancelling all flows on logout
* Navigating on success/failure
* Persisting login state (storage, cookies)

Using sagas gives you **explicit control** over all of this in a clean, centralized, testable way.

---

## 🔁 High-Level Flow

| Action          | Saga Responsibility                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `LOGIN_REQUEST` | Try login API, handle success/fail            |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Use refresh token, get new token              |
| `LOGOUT`        | Cancel ongoing sagas, clear storage, redirect |

---

## 🛠 1. Login Saga

```ts
function* loginSaga(action) {
  try {
    const { token, refreshToken } = yield call(api.login, action.payload);
    yield put({ type: "LOGIN_SUCCESS", payload: token });

    localStorage.setItem("token", token);
    localStorage.setItem("refreshToken", refreshToken);
  } catch (err) {
    yield put({ type: "LOGIN_FAILED", error: err.message });
  }
}
```

---

## 🔁 2. Token Refresh Flow (Background Auto-Renew)

```ts
function* tokenRefresher() {
  while (true) {
    yield delay(10 * 60 * 1000); // wait 10 min (before token expires)

    try {
      const refreshToken = localStorage.getItem("refreshToken");
      const { token } = yield call(api.refreshToken, refreshToken);

      localStorage.setItem("token", token);
      yield put({ type: "TOKEN_REFRESHED", payload: token });
    } catch (err) {
      yield put({ type: "TOKEN_REFRESH_FAILED" });
      yield put({ type: "LOGOUT" }); // fallback logout
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🔒 3. Protected API Saga (Inject Token)

```ts
function* fetchUserData() {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  const result = yield call(api.getUser, token);
  yield put({ type: "USER_DATA_SUCCESS", payload: result });
}
```

---

## 🚪 4. Logout Saga

```ts
function* logoutSaga() {
  yield call(api.logout);
  localStorage.clear();

  yield put({ type: "CLEAR_APP_STATE" });
  yield call(navigate, "/login"); // optional redirection
}
```

## 🧠 Watcher Saga Pattern

```ts
function* authWatcher() {
  yield takeEvery("LOGIN_REQUEST", loginSaga);
  yield takeEvery("LOGOUT", logoutSaga);
  yield fork(tokenRefresher);
}
```

If the user logs out → you may want to `cancel(tokenRefresher)` too.

### 🧼 Cleanup + Race Conditions (Advanced)

You can race refresh + logout like this:

```ts
function* sessionManager() {
  while (true) {
    const loginAction = yield take("LOGIN_SUCCESS");

    const refresher = yield fork(tokenRefresher);

    yield take("LOGOUT");
    yield cancel(refresher);
  }
}
```

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Login         | `call`, `put`, `try/catch`, storage         |
| Refresh Token | `delay`, `call`, `take`, background control |
| Auto Logout   | `cancel`, `clear`, redirect                 |
| Session Mgmt  | `fork`, `take`, `race`, `cancel`            |
