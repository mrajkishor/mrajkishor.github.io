# üîê A Complete Guide to AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

In today‚Äôs cloud-first world, encryption is a critical part of securing sensitive data. AWS makes this simpler with **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** ‚Äî a fully managed service that enables you to create and control encryption keys used to secure your data.

---

## üöÄ What is AWS KMS?

AWS KMS handles **encryption keys** for various AWS services (like S3, EBS, RDS, etc.). Whenever you hear ‚Äúencryption‚Äù in AWS, it‚Äôs most likely powered by KMS.

### üîë Key Benefits:
- AWS manages encryption keys securely.
- Seamlessly integrated with IAM for access control.
- ==Logs every usage via AWS CloudTrail for auditing.==
- Easily controls access to encrypted data.
- Available via API, SDK, or CLI.

> ‚ùó **Never store secrets in plaintext, especially in your code.** Use KMS to encrypt them and store securely in ==environment variables== or ==AWS Secrets Manager==.

## üß© Types of KMS Keys

### 1. **Symmetric Keys (AES-256)**
- Single key for both encryption and decryption.
- Default type used by AWS services.
- You never get direct access to the key ‚Äî all actions go through the KMS API.

### 2. **Asymmetric Keys (RSA/ECC)**
- Use public/private key pairs.
- Public key (for encryption) is downloadable.
- Private key (for decryption) is securely kept in KMS and never exposed.
- Useful for signing/verifying or external applications that can't call KMS directly.

## üè∑Ô∏è Key Types by Ownership

| Key Type                     | Description                         | Cost            |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **AWS Owned Keys**          | Default, used transparently         | Free            |
| **AWS Managed Keys**        | Named keys for specific services    | Free            |
| **Customer Managed Keys**   | You create and manage               | $1/month        |
| **Imported Keys**           | You import your own keys            | $1/month        |

‚û°Ô∏è Additionally, you pay for API usage: `$0.03 / 10,000 calls`

## üîÅ Automatic Key Rotation

| Key Type                 | Rotation Capability                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| AWS-Managed Keys         | Automatic every 1 year                 |
| Customer-Managed Keys    | Must enable rotation manually          |
| Imported Keys            | Only manual rotation with aliases     |


> **Note** : In AWS, key rotation is the process of regularly replacing the cryptographic key material used for encryption, either automatically or manually, to enhance security and limit the impact of potential key compromise. Key rotation replaces the cryptographic key material, but the key ID (the identifier of the KMS key) and other metadata remain the same. AWS KMS does not automatically re-encrypt data when a key is rotated; instead, it uses the appropriate key material to decrypt data encrypted with older versions.

## üåç Copying Snapshots Across Regions

When copying EBS snapshots between regions:
1. **EBS Volume** is encrypted with **KMS Key A** in region `eu-west-2`.
2. Snapshot is created and encrypted using **Key A**.
3. Snapshot is copied to `ap-southeast-2` and **re-encrypted** with **KMS Key B**.

> ‚úÖ **KMS ReEncrypt** enables secure transfer and re-encryption with the new region's key.

## üë• KMS Key Policies

Like S3 bucket policies, **KMS Key Policies** control who can use or manage keys.

### üîê Policy Types:
- **Default Policy**:  
  - Auto-created if none specified.  
  - Grants full access to root user.

- **Custom Policy**:  
  - Defines who can access/administer the key.  
  - Useful for cross-account access.

---

## üîÑ Copying Snapshots Across Accounts

1. Create a snapshot encrypted with a **customer-managed KMS key**.
2. **Attach a KMS Key Policy** allowing cross-account access.
3. Share the encrypted snapshot.
4. In the target account, **copy and re-encrypt** with the local KMS key.
5. Create a volume from the re-encrypted snapshot.

```json
{
  "Sid": "Allow use of the key with destination account",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::TARGET-ACCOUNT-ID:role/ROLENAME"
  },
  "Action": [
    "kms:Decrypt",
    "kms:CreateGrant"
  ],
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "kms:ViaService": "ec2.REGION.amazonaws.com",
      "kms:CallerAccount": "TARGET-ACCOUNT-ID"
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature                | Benefit                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **KMS Key Types**      | Symmetric (default) and Asymmetric (advanced) |
| **Ownership Options**  | AWS-owned, AWS-managed, or customer-managed   |
| **Integration**        | Native with most AWS services                 |
| **Security**           | IAM integration + CloudTrail audit logs       |
| **Compliance**         | Meets compliance for encryption at rest       |

### üß† Final Thought:
**AWS KMS is the backbone of cloud encryption.**  
It not only simplifies encryption but also enforces strong access control and auditability, making your data secure ‚Äî whether at rest, in transit, or across regions and accounts.
