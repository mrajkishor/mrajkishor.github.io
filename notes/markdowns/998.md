##  **Serializability**

---

### 🔹 What is Serializability?

**Serializability** is the **gold standard for correctness** in concurrent transaction execution. It ensures that the **final outcome** of concurrent transactions is **equivalent to some serial schedule** (i.e., where transactions execute one after the other, without interleaving).

🧾 Formally, a schedule is **serializable** if it produces the same result as some **serial schedule** while allowing **interleaved execution**.

---

### 🔄 Why Serializability Matters

Without serializability, **race conditions** or **anomalies** can occur — such as:

* Lost updates
* Dirty reads
* Inconsistent reads
* Phantom reads

To avoid these, DBMS ensures schedules are serializable.

## 🧮 Types of Serializability (GATE Focus)

There are **three types** of serializability to understand. GATE focuses mainly on the **first two**.

---

### 1️⃣ **Conflict Serializability (CSR)** ✅

> A schedule is **conflict-serializable** if it can be transformed into a serial schedule **by swapping non-conflicting operations**.

🔑 **Two operations conflict** if:

* Belong to different transactions
* Access the same data item
* At least one is a **write**

| Operation   | Conflict? |
| ----------- | --------- |
| R(X) & R(X) | ❌         |
| R(X) & W(X) | ✅         |
| W(X) & R(X) | ✅         |
| W(X) & W(X) | ✅         |

#### ✅ How to Check Conflict Serializability

We use the **Precedence Graph (Serialization Graph):**

1. **Nodes** = Transactions
2. **Edges** = Ti → Tj if an operation in Ti **conflicts** with and **precedes** one in Tj
3. **Check for cycles**:

   * **Acyclic → Conflict Serializable**
   * **Cycle → Not Conflict Serializable**

📘 GATE asks this via:

* Giving a schedule (like S = R1(X), W2(X), …)
* Asking if it's conflict-serializable

---

### 2️⃣ **View Serializability (VSR)** ⚠️ (Less common in GATE)

> A schedule is **view-serializable** if each transaction **reads the same values** and **writes final values** as some serial schedule.

📌 Every conflict-serializable schedule is view-serializable, but not vice versa:

```
CSR ⊆ VSR
```

🟡 **Use cases**: GATE rarely asks this directly unless to **differentiate from conflict serializability**

---

### 3️⃣ **Final State Serializability** ❌ (Not GATE relevant)

Only considers final DB state — not allowed in real DBMS because it may violate isolation.

---

## 🧪 GATE-Type Example

🔢 **Schedule S**:

```
R1(X), W1(X), R2(X), W2(X)
```

* Conflict: W1(X) ↔ R2(X) → edge T1 → T2
* Conflict: R1(X) ↔ W2(X) → edge T1 → T2
* Conflict: W1(X) ↔ W2(X) → edge T1 → T2

➡️ All edges go from T1 → T2 → No cycles
✅ **Schedule is Conflict Serializable**

## 🧠 Common Anomalies When Not Serializable

| Anomaly                       | Cause                                   | Prevented by             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Dirty Read**                | Reading uncommitted write               | Isolation                |
| **Lost Update**               | Overwriting a write                     | Conflict Serializability |
| **Unrepeatable Read**         | Data read twice gives different result  | View Serializability     |
| **Write Skew / Phantom Read** | Conditional updates violate consistency | Serializable isolation   |

| Type                     | Definition                                      | Check             | GATE Focus |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Conflict Serializability | Swap non-conflicting ops to get serial schedule | Precedence Graph  | ✅✅✅        |
| View Serializability     | Reads/writes match serial schedule views        | Intuitive/Manual  | ⚠️ Low     |
| Final State              | Same final state only                           | Not valid in DBMS | ❌          |

## 🧨 Pro Tips

* Practice **Precedence Graphs** till you can solve them under 30 seconds
* Watch for **write-write conflicts** — they often cause cycles
* Be clear on **conflict vs non-conflict** operations
* Know that **conflict serializability is stricter but easier to test**
