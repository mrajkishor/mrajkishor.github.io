### 🚀 Building Microfrontend Apps / **Lazy Loading and Bundle Splitting**

---

Lazy loading and bundle splitting are essential performance optimization strategies in **microfrontend (MFE)** architectures. They ensure that each independently built and deployed frontend (MFE) loads only what it needs — when it needs it — resulting in **faster initial load times**, better **runtime performance**, and **reduced memory usage**.

---

## 🔍 What is Lazy Loading?

Lazy loading is a technique where components or modules are **loaded on-demand**, rather than all at once during the initial application load.

In the context of MFEs:

* Remote modules (other MFEs) are loaded **only when needed**
* Reduces initial **JavaScript payload size**
* Speeds up **Time-to-Interactive (TTI)**

---

## 🎁 What is Bundle Splitting?

Bundle splitting means breaking up your application into **multiple smaller bundles** instead of shipping a single, large JavaScript file.

Types:

* **Entry point splitting**: One bundle per entry (e.g., login, dashboard)
* **Vendor splitting**: Separates libraries like `react`, `redux`, etc.
* **Dynamic import splitting**: Splits components loaded via `import()`

---

## 🔄 How It Works in Microfrontends

### ✅ Lazy Load MFEs via `Module Federation`

```tsx
// Shell App - Lazy loading a remote component
const OrdersApp = React.lazy(() => import('orders/OrdersApp'));

function OrdersPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <OrdersApp />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

This ensures the `OrdersApp` is fetched **only when the user navigates** to the relevant route/page.

---

### ⚙️ Webpack Config: Enable Code Splitting

Ensure `output.chunkFilename` and `optimization.splitChunks` are configured in **Webpack**:

```js
module.exports = {
  output: {
    filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',
    chunkFilename: '[name].[contenthash].chunk.js'
  },
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
      cacheGroups: {
        vendors: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
          name: 'vendors',
          chunks: 'all'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 📦 Module Federation + Code Splitting

With **Webpack Module Federation**, each MFE can:

* Expose specific components (`OrdersApp`, `CartWidget`)
* Generate its own `remoteEntry.js` and additional split bundles
* Be lazy-loaded by the host or other MFEs

### Example:

```js
// orders/webpack.config.js
exposes: {
  './OrdersApp': './src/OrdersApp',
}
```

On demand, this triggers loading of:

* `remoteEntry.js` (manifest)
* Chunked bundles like `OrdersApp.chunk.js`, `vendors.chunk.js`

---

## ⚡ React Lazy + Suspense

Use `React.lazy()` to import MFE components dynamically:

```tsx
const RemoteCart = React.lazy(() => import('cart/CartWidget'));
```

Wrap in `Suspense` to avoid runtime crashes during loading.

## 🧱 Benefits

| Benefit                    | Description                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ⚡ Faster initial load      | Only loads shell; MFEs load on-demand        |
| 🧠 Efficient memory usage  | Avoids unused code in memory                 |
| 🌐 Better network behavior | Smaller payloads, parallel async loading     |
| 📦 Independent deployment  | Each MFE manages its own bundles and updates |

---

## 🔁 Real-World Usage Pattern

| Route                | Loaded Bundles                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/home`              | shell + navbar + footer                      |
| `/orders`            | + orders/remoteEntry.js + ordersApp.chunk.js |
| `/cart` (side panel) | + cart/remoteEntry.js + cartWidget.chunk.js  |

## 🛑 Pitfalls to Avoid

| Problem                  | Solution                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⌛ Long fallback screens  | Use meaningful loading indicators with estimated delay          |
| 🧱 Chunk duplication     | Share dependencies via `shared: { react: { singleton: true } }` |
| 🔁 Infinite reload loops | Ensure remotes are registered only once per page lifecycle      |
| 🧩 Version mismatch      | Use semantic version control or shared contracts                |

---

## 🛠️ Best Practices

* **Use `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`** for component-level lazy loading
* **Split large libraries** (e.g., charting, maps) into separate bundles
* **Set up shared dependencies** in `ModuleFederationPlugin`
* **Serve static assets via CDN** for cache reuse
* **Use dynamic imports** in routes and modals for deferred loading

## ✅ Summary

| Concept          | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lazy Loading     | Loads remote MFEs or components only when needed             |
| Bundle Splitting | Divides codebase into manageable, cacheable chunks           |
| Tools Used       | React.lazy, Webpack splitChunks, Module Federation, Suspense |
| Outcome          | Faster loads, better UX, scalable architecture               |

Lazy loading and bundle splitting are **non-negotiable practices** when building performant microfrontend apps at scale. Combined with Webpack Module Federation and proper dependency sharing, they ensure **snappy UX** and **deployable independence** across your microfrontend system.
