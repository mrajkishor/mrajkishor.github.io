# **Concurrency Problems in DBMS: A Detailed Overview with Examples**

Concurrency in Database Management Systems (DBMS) refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple transactions to maximize system performance. While concurrency is essential for better throughput, it can lead to several **data anomalies** and **integrity issues** if not handled properly. This blog will explore all major concurrency problems in DBMS with detailed explanations and examples.

## **What is Concurrency?**

Concurrency allows multiple transactions to access and manipulate the database at the same time. Transactions are logical units of work that must adhere to the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Without proper concurrency control mechanisms, issues such as **inconsistent data** or **violations of database integrity** may arise.

## **Major Concurrency Problems in DBMS**

### **1. Lost Update**
   - **Definition**: Occurs when two or more transactions read the same data and update it without proper synchronization, causing one update to overwrite the other.

   - **Example**:
     ```
     Initial Balance in Account A = $500

     T1: Read(A) → $500
     T2: Read(A) → $500
     T1: Write(A) → A - $100 → $400
     T2: Write(A) → A - $50 → $450
     
     Final Balance in Account A = $450 (T1's update is lost)
     ```

   - **Problem**: T2 overwrites T1's update, leading to data inconsistency.

---

### **2. Dirty Read (Uncommitted Dependency)**
   - **Definition**: Occurs when a transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction, which may later be rolled back.

   - **Example**:
     ```
     T1: Write(A) → $600
     T2: Read(A) → $600
     T1: Rollback (A reverts to $500)
     
     Final Balance in T2 = $600 (incorrect, as T1's change was rolled back)
     ```

   - **Problem**: T2 uses uncommitted data, leading to incorrect results.

---

### **3. Non-Repeatable Read**
   - **Definition**: Occurs when a transaction reads the same data multiple times and gets different values due to updates by other transactions.

   - **Example**:
     ```
     T1: Read(A) → $500
     T2: Write(A) → A = $600
     T1: Read(A) → $600
     ```

   - **Problem**: T1 reads different values for the same data, causing inconsistency.

---

### **4. Phantom Read**
   - **Definition**: Occurs when a transaction reads a set of rows that changes due to insertions or deletions by another transaction.

   - **Example**:
     ```
     T1: SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Amount > $100
     Result: {Order1, Order2}

     T2: INSERT INTO Orders (Order3 with Amount $150)
     T1: Re-execute SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Amount > $100
     Result: {Order1, Order2, Order3}
     ```

   - **Problem**: T1 encounters a new row (`Order3`) in its second read, leading to inconsistent results.

---

### **5. Incorrect Summary**
   - **Definition**: Occurs when a transaction calculates an aggregate value (like SUM) while other transactions are updating the underlying data.

   - **Example**:
     ```
     Initial Balances: Account A = $500, Account B = $300

     T1: SUM(A + B) → $800
     T2: Write(A) → A = $400
     T2: Write(B) → B = $200
     ```

   - **Problem**: T1 calculates a summary that becomes incorrect as T2 updates the balances during its execution.

---

### **6. Serialization Anomaly**
   - **Definition**: Occurs when the execution order of transactions does not produce the same result as a serial execution.

   - **Example**:
     ```
     Serial Order: T1 → T2
     Result: A = $400, B = $600

     Interleaved Execution:
     T1: Read(A) → $500
     T2: Write(B) → $600
     T1: Write(A) → $400

     Result: A = $400, B = $600 (same final state, but intermediate states were inconsistent)
     ```

   - **Problem**: May cause intermediate inconsistency, even though the final state is correct.

## **Concurrency Control Techniques to Avoid Problems**

Concurrency problems can be mitigated using **Concurrency Control Mechanisms**, which ensure transactions adhere to the **Isolation** property.

### **1. Lock-Based Protocols**
   - **Shared Lock (S)**: Allows multiple transactions to read a data item.
   - **Exclusive Lock (X)**: Allows only one transaction to write a data item.
   - **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**:
     - **Growing Phase**: Locks are acquired.
     - **Shrinking Phase**: Locks are released.
   - **Problem Avoided**: Lost Updates, Dirty Reads.

### **2. Timestamp-Based Protocols**
   - Transactions are assigned timestamps to determine the execution order.
   - **Problem Avoided**: Non-Repeatable Reads, Serialization Anomalies.

### **3. Validation-Based Protocols**
   - Transactions are validated before committing to ensure no conflicts occur.
   - **Problem Avoided**: Dirty Reads, Phantom Reads.

### **4. Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)**
   - Keeps multiple versions of data for read operations.
   - **Problem Avoided**: Non-Repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads.

## **Example: Solving Concurrency Problems**

### **Scenario**:
Two transactions update the balance of an account simultaneously.

- **Initial State**: Balance = $500

**Without Locking:**
```
T1: Read(A) → $500
T2: Read(A) → $500
T1: Write(A) → $400
T2: Write(A) → $450
Final Balance = $450 (T1's update is lost)
```

**With Locking:**
```
T1: Lock(A)
T1: Read(A) → $500
T1: Write(A) → $400
T1: Unlock(A)
T2: Lock(A)
T2: Read(A) → $400
T2: Write(A) → $350
T2: Unlock(A)
Final Balance = $350 (No lost updates)
```
