### 🔹 Topic: **Bubble Sort**

## 🔹 1. **What is Bubble Sort?**

**Bubble Sort** is a simple **comparison-based** sorting algorithm where **adjacent elements are repeatedly compared and swapped** if they are in the wrong order.

> The largest elements "bubble up" to the end in each pass — hence the name.

---

## 🔹 2. **How Bubble Sort Works**

For an array `arr[0…n-1]`, the process:

1. Start from index 0 to n−2
2. Compare adjacent pairs `arr[j]` and `arr[j+1]`
3. If `arr[j] > arr[j+1]`, swap them
4. After each pass, the largest unsorted element reaches its correct position
5. Repeat this for `n−1` passes or until no swaps are needed (optimized version)

---

### ✅ Example:

```text
Initial:    [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]

Pass 1:     [1, 4, 2, 5, 8]  
Pass 2:     [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]  
Pass 3:     [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]  (no swaps → sorted)
```

## 🔹 3. **Python Implementation**

### ✅ Basic Version:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n - i - 1):  # last i elements are sorted
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
```

### ✅ Optimized Version (Early Stop):

```python
def bubble_sort_optimized(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break  # array is sorted early
```

## 🔹 4. **Time and Space Complexity**

| Case         | Comparisons | Swaps         | Time Complexity          | Space |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ----- |
| Best Case    | n−1         | 0 (if sorted) | O(n) (with optimization) | O(1)  |
| Worst Case   | n(n−1)/2    | n(n−1)/2      | O(n²)                    | O(1)  |
| Average Case | \~n²        | \~n²          | O(n²)                    | O(1)  |

## 🔹 5. **Key Characteristics**

| Feature         | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| In-place        | ✅ Yes (no extra space used)                    |
| Stable          | ✅ Yes (equal elements retain order)            |
| Adaptive        | ✅ Yes (optimized version detects sorted input) |
| Swaps           | ❌ Expensive in high swap scenarios             |
| Educational Use | ✅ Good for learning sorting logic              |

## 🔹 6. **When to Use Bubble Sort**

* Small data size
* Teaching/learning sorting logic
* When **stability** is important and **insertion sort** is not suitable
* Not preferred for large data due to poor time efficiency

## 🔹 7. **Comparison with Other O(n²) Sorts**

| Feature   | Bubble Sort | Selection Sort | Insertion Sort |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Stable    | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes          |
| Best Case | O(n)        | O(n²)          | O(n)           |
| Adaptive  | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes          |
| Swaps     | High        | Minimal        | Moderate       |

| Suitable for GATE?     | ✅ Yes (trace, complexity, concept) |

## ✅ Final Tips for GATE

* Focus on **complexity** and **comparative analysis**
* Practice **dry run traces** — GATE may ask array state after one or two passes
* Understand when Bubble Sort does fewer operations (sorted or nearly sorted input)
* Know it’s **not efficient for large datasets**
