## üîç What is Topological Sorting?

**Topological Sorting** of a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is a linear ordering of its nodes such that:

> For every directed edge `u ‚Üí v`, node `u` appears **before** `v` in the ordering.

Think of it as **scheduling tasks with dependencies**, where some tasks must be completed before others.

## üì¶ Real-Life Examples

| Use Case             | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Build Systems        | Compile source files in dependency order |
| Task Scheduling      | Complete tasks respecting prerequisites  |
| Course Prerequisites | Take courses in order                    |
| Git                  | Commit dependency trees                  |
| Project Planning     | Task dependencies in Gantt charts        |

## üß† When to Use?

You should use **topological sort** when:

* The problem mentions **dependencies**, **prerequisites**, or **ordering**.
* You are working with a **DAG** (no cycles allowed).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms to Perform Topological Sort

There are **two main algorithms**:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm (BFS Approach)**

#### Steps:

1. Compute **in-degree** of all nodes.
2. Push all nodes with in-degree `0` into a queue.
3. Pop a node, add it to result, and reduce in-degree of its neighbors.
4. If in-degree of neighbor becomes `0`, push it to queue.
5. If all nodes are processed, return result.

#### Java Code:

```java
List<Integer> topoSort(int n, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
    int[] indegree = new int[n];
    for (int u = 0; u < n; u++) {
        for (int v : graph.get(u)) indegree[v]++;
    }

    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if (indegree[i] == 0) queue.offer(i);

    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int node = queue.poll();
        result.add(node);
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (--indegree[neighbor] == 0) queue.offer(neighbor);
        }
    }

    if (result.size() < n) throw new RuntimeException("Cycle detected! No topological order.");
    return result;
}
```

#### Time & Space:

* **Time**: `O(V + E)`
* **Space**: `O(V + E)`

### ‚úÖ 2. **DFS-Based Topological Sort**

#### Steps:

1. Do a DFS from each unvisited node.
2. After visiting all neighbors, **push the node onto a stack**.
3. Reverse the stack at the end to get the topological order.

#### Java Code:

```java
void dfs(int u, boolean[] visited, Stack<Integer> stack, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
    visited[u] = true;
    for (int v : graph.get(u)) {
        if (!visited[v]) dfs(v, visited, stack, graph);
    }
    stack.push(u);
}

List<Integer> topoSortDFS(int n, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) dfs(i, visited, stack, graph);
    }

    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) result.add(stack.pop());
    return result;
}
```

## üö´ What If the Graph Has a Cycle?

**Topological sort is not possible** on graphs with cycles.

To **detect cycles**:

* In **Kahn‚Äôs algorithm**: If result list size < `n`, there‚Äôs a cycle.
* In **DFS-based approach**: Use a recursion stack to check for back edges.

## ‚úÖ Final Tips for Interviews

* Always **check for cycles** before attempting topological sort.
* Mention **both Kahn‚Äôs and DFS approaches** if asked.
* Practice problems involving **courses, builds, jobs, and ordering**.
* Topo sort is a fundamental part of **dependency resolution** in large systems and compilers.
