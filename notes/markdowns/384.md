# 🔐 Sharing Encrypted AMIs Across AWS Accounts Using KMS

When working with **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)** in a multi-account setup, there are often requirements to share AMIs across AWS accounts securely. If the AMIs are **encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**, the process involves additional steps to ensure proper access and decryption in the target account.

In this blog, we break down the step-by-step process for **sharing KMS-encrypted AMIs** between AWS accounts and highlight key security and permission considerations.

## 🧱 What is an AMI?

An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a snapshot of a configured EC2 environment, containing everything needed to launch an EC2 instance—OS, application server, and applications. AMIs can be:
- Public
- Private (within an account)
- **Shared across accounts** (the focus of this post)

If an AMI is encrypted, you need to manage not just the image, but also the **KMS key access**.

## 🔐 Step-by-Step: AMI Sharing with KMS Encryption

### **1. Encrypt AMI in the Source Account**
- The AMI resides in **Account A** and is encrypted using a **KMS key** from the same account.
- This encryption is often done when the EBS volumes behind the AMI snapshots are encrypted.

### **2. Modify AMI Launch Permissions**
- You must **explicitly add the target AWS Account (Account B)** to the AMI’s **launch permissions** using `modify-image-attribute` API or AWS Console.
- This allows Account B to see and launch the shared AMI.

### **3. Share the KMS Key**
- The KMS key used to encrypt the EBS snapshot backing the AMI must be **shared with Account B**.
- This involves updating the **KMS key policy** to include the **IAM user/role** or the **entire account** from Account B.

### **4. IAM Permissions in the Target Account**
- The IAM role or user launching the EC2 instance in Account B must have the following permissions on the shared KMS key:
  - `kms:DescribeKey`
  - `kms:ReEncrypt*`
  - `kms:CreateGrant`
  - `kms:Decrypt`

Without these permissions, Account B will not be able to launch EC2 instances from the shared AMI.

### **5. Optional: Re-Encrypt Volumes in Target Account**
- When launching the EC2 instance, Account B can **specify a different KMS key** from their own account to **re-encrypt the root and data volumes**.
- This ensures that future operations in Account B remain fully under its control.

## ✅ Best Practices

- 🔐 **Limit key access**: Share the KMS key only with the necessary IAM roles/users.
- 🔄 **Use cross-account IAM roles** to simplify key sharing and access control.
- 🧩 **Use custom KMS keys** (rather than AWS-managed keys) for flexibility in sharing and auditing.
- 🔍 **Monitor with AWS CloudTrail** to audit key usage across accounts.

## 📌 Summary

Sharing an **encrypted AMI across AWS accounts** isn't just about modifying launch permissions. It’s a multi-step process involving **KMS key sharing**, **IAM policy configuration**, and **optional re-encryption** in the target account. Done correctly, it enables **secure, compliant, and auditable** sharing of machine images across teams or organizations.

> Security and permissions are central to this process. Always follow the **principle of least privilege** when sharing AMIs and KMS keys.
