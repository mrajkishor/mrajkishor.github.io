## 🔷 **1. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**

### 🔑 Definition:

ECC is a public-key encryption method that operates over **elliptic curves defined on finite fields**. Security is based on the difficulty of solving the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**.

### ⚙️ Features:

* Uses **smaller key sizes** (e.g., 256-bit ECC ≈ 3072-bit RSA).
* Faster computations, lower energy use.

### 📱 Applications:

* **SSL/TLS** encryption for websites.
* **Digital signatures** (ECDSA in Bitcoin).
* Secure communication in **IoT** and **mobile** platforms.

### 📦 Tools:

* **OpenSSL**, **FIPS 186-4**, **Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)**.

## 🧮 **2. Homomorphic Encryption**

### 🔑 Definition:

Encryption that allows **computation on encrypted data**, without needing to decrypt it.

### 🔍 Types:

* **Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)** – limited operations.
* **Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE)** – limited depth circuits.
* **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** – arbitrary computation support.

### 🛠 Applications:

* **Cloud computing** (privacy-preserving processing).
* **Healthcare** – encrypted diagnosis.
* **Banking** – risk analysis on encrypted customer data.

### ⚠️ Challenges:

* **Performance overhead**, still computationally expensive.

## ⚛️ **3. Quantum Cryptography**

### 🔑 Definition:

Relies on principles of **quantum mechanics** rather than computational hardness.

### 📌 Example: **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**

* Uses **qubits (photons)** to generate secret keys.
* **Any interception alters the key**, alerting parties to an attack.

### 🧪 Applications:

* Used in **national defense**, **finance**, **diplomatic communication**.
* Real-world deployments in **Switzerland** and **China**.

### 🔮 Future Scope:

* Will secure **post-quantum communication**.

## 🧩 **4. Lattice-Based Cryptography**

### 🔑 Definition:

Built on the hardness of problems in **lattices** (high-dimensional grids).

### 🌟 Key Advantages:

* **Quantum-resistant**
* Efficient key generation and encryption
* Used in **fully homomorphic encryption**, **digital signatures**, and **zero-knowledge proofs**.

### 🔐 Applications:

* Post-quantum cryptography
* NIST-standardized schemes like **Kyber** (for key exchange) and **Dilithium** (for signatures)

---

## 🔗 **5. Blockchain Cryptography**

### 🔑 Definition:

**Blockchain** is a decentralized ledger system protected using **cryptographic primitives**.

### 🧱 Components:

* **Hashing (SHA-256)**: Ensures block integrity.
* **Public-Key Cryptography (ECDSA)**: Used for digital signatures in wallets.
* **Consensus Algorithms**: Rely on cryptographic proof-of-work/stake.

### 📦 Applications:

* **Cryptocurrencies** (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
* **Supply chain**, **digital voting**, **NFTs**, **identity management**

---

## ⚠️ **6. Side-Channel Attacks & Countermeasures**

### 🔍 Definition:

Attacks that exploit **physical characteristics** (power usage, timing, EM emissions) of a cryptosystem rather than the algorithm itself.

### 💥 Examples:

* **Timing attacks**
* **Differential Power Analysis (DPA)**
* **Electromagnetic leakage**

### 🛡 Countermeasures:

* **Masking** sensitive data
* **Random delays** during computation
* **Noise injection**
* Hardware hardening (e.g., in smart cards)

### 🏦 Use Case:

Smart cards and secure banking chips integrate side-channel resistance techniques.
