### 🧠 What’s a Monorepo (and Why Do People Use It)?

A **monorepo** is a single repository that holds **multiple related projects or packages**.
Instead of splitting your frontend, backend, shared utilities, and component libraries into separate Git repos — you keep everything in one place.

Big companies like Google, Facebook, and Uber use monorepos to:

* Keep versioning and dependencies in sync
* Share code (like UI components or utils) between apps
* Make cross-team collaboration easier

Now, if you're using Webpack in a monorepo, things get... interesting.

### 🧩 What Challenges Come Up?

Webpack wasn’t originally built with monorepos in mind. So, when you try to:

* Import shared code from another package
* Build multiple apps with shared config
* Optimize caching and chunking across apps

...you start hitting issues like:

* `Module not found` errors from sibling packages
* Babel not transpiling shared packages properly
* Caching problems or large, bloated vendor chunks

But don’t worry — there are clean ways to handle it.

### 🛠️ How to Use Webpack in a Monorepo

#### ✅ 1. **Transpile Shared Packages**

If you have shared code (like a design system) in a sibling package (`packages/ui/`), make sure Webpack processes it using `babel-loader`.

```js
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.(js|ts|tsx)$/,
      include: [
        path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
        path.resolve(__dirname, '../packages/ui') // shared package
      ],
      use: 'babel-loader'
    }
  ]
}
```

Otherwise, Webpack may ignore it, assuming it’s already built (like stuff in `node_modules`).

---

#### ✅ 2. **Use Aliases or Module Resolution**

You can avoid messy relative imports by using Webpack aliases:

```js
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@ui': path.resolve(__dirname, '../packages/ui/src')
  }
}
```

Now you can import like:

```js
import Button from '@ui/Button';
```

Cleaner, more readable — and easier to refactor later.

---

#### ✅ 3. **Customize Caching and Chunk Splitting**

When you build multiple apps in a monorepo, their shared code may get bundled separately — not ideal for browser caching.

Using `SplitChunksPlugin` smartly ensures:

* Shared vendors go into a common chunk
* Caching stays effective across multiple builds

---

#### ✅ 4. **Webpack Config Reuse**

To avoid repeating config in every app, extract shared Webpack config into a base file:

```js
// webpack.base.js
module.exports = {
  resolve: { extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'] },
  module: { ... },
  plugins: [ ... ]
};
```

Then extend it in individual app configs using `webpack-merge`:

```js
const { merge } = require('webpack-merge');
const baseConfig = require('../../webpack.base.js');

module.exports = merge(baseConfig, {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  // app-specific config
});
```

### 🔍 Tools That Help

* **Yarn Workspaces / pnpm / npm workspaces** — for linking packages
* **Lerna / Nx / Turborepo** — for build orchestration, caching, and task running
* **Module Federation** — for sharing runtime code between apps (instead of static linking)

### 🎯 Final Thought

Webpack can absolutely handle monorepos — you just need to set it up with a bit more care.
Once it’s in place, you get a really smooth dev workflow with shared code, optimized builds, and less duplication.
