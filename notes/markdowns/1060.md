### Connectivity And Components

---

## üîç Introduction

In graph theory, **connectivity** refers to how vertices in a graph are connected to each other. The concept of **connected components** helps identify isolated subgraphs and plays a critical role in network analysis, clustering, and real-world applications such as social networks, internet infrastructure, and distributed systems.

Understanding **connected components** and **graph connectivity** is essential for solving problems involving reachability, bridge detection, articulation points, and graph traversal.

## üìö Key Concepts

---

### üîπ 1. Connected Graph

* A graph is **connected** if there is a **path between every pair of vertices**.
* Applies to **undirected graphs**.
* If a graph is not connected, it is made of multiple **connected components**.

---

### üîπ 2. Strongly and Weakly Connected Graphs (Directed Graphs)

* A **strongly connected graph** is a directed graph where **there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex**.
* A **weakly connected graph** is a directed graph where **replacing all directed edges with undirected edges makes it connected**.

---

### üîπ 3. Connected Components (Undirected Graphs)

* A **connected component** is a maximal subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths.
* The number of such components can be found using:

  * **DFS**
  * **BFS**
  * **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**

---

### üîπ 4. Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)

* For **directed graphs**, SCCs are maximal subgraphs such that **each node is reachable from every other node** in the same subgraph.
* Algorithms to find SCC:

  * **Kosaraju‚Äôs Algorithm**
  * **Tarjan‚Äôs Algorithm**

### ‚úÖ 1. Finding Connected Components (Undirected Graph)

#### Algorithm (DFS or BFS):

```python
def dfs(node, visited, adj):
    visited[node] = True
    for neighbor in adj[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            dfs(neighbor, visited, adj)

count = 0
for v in range(n):
    if not visited[v]:
        dfs(v, visited, adj)
        count += 1  # Each DFS identifies one component
```

* **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
* **Space Complexity:** O(V)

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Kosaraju‚Äôs Algorithm (SCC in Directed Graphs)

#### Steps:

1. Do DFS and store nodes in stack by **finishing time**.
2. **Transpose** the graph (reverse all edges).
3. Do DFS on transposed graph using order in stack.

* **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
* **Space Complexity:** O(V)

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Tarjan‚Äôs Algorithm (SCC in Directed Graphs)

* Uses **low-link values** and **DFS traversal**.

* Maintains a stack and discovers SCCs using recursion backtracking.

* **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)

* **Space Complexity:** O(V)

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)

* Alternate approach to count connected components.
* Efficient for **dynamic edge additions**.

#### Operations:

* `find(x)`: Finds root of x.

* `union(x, y)`: Merges sets containing x and y.

* **Time Complexity:** O(Œ±(N)), where Œ± is inverse Ackermann function (almost constant).
