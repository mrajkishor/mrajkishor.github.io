### 🔹 What is `componentWillUnmount()`?

`componentWillUnmount()` is a lifecycle method in **class components** that is called **just before a component is removed from the DOM**. It is used to perform **cleanup operations** such as:

- Clearing timers
- Removing event listeners
- Cancelling API calls
- Cleaning up subscriptions (e.g., WebSocket, Redux, Context, etc.)

---

### 📍 Syntax

```jsx
componentWillUnmount() {
  // cleanup logic
}
```

This method does **not receive any parameters**, and it is the **last lifecycle method** invoked before the component is destroyed.

### 🧠 Key Characteristics

| Feature                     | Description                                             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔁 Called only once         | Runs exactly once before the component unmounts         |
| 🧹 Ideal for cleanup        | Best place to free up resources to avoid memory leaks   |
| 🚫 Cannot call `setState()` | The component is being removed—no state updates allowed |

---

### ✅ Use Cases

- Clearing `setInterval` or `setTimeout`
- Removing event listeners from `window`, `document`, or DOM nodes
- Unsubscribing from external services (e.g., Pub/Sub, WebSocket)
- Logging unmounting behavior (debugging or analytics)

---

### 📦 Example: Cleaning up a timer

```jsx
class Timer extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      console.log("Tick");
    }, 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.intervalId); // Cleanup
    console.log("Timer stopped and cleaned up");
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Timer is running...</div>;
  }
}
```

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistake

**Not cleaning up subscriptions or listeners** may lead to:

- Memory leaks
- Unexpected app behavior (e.g., calling functions on unmounted components)

✅ Always pair any **setup** in `componentDidMount()` with **cleanup** in `componentWillUnmount()`.

---

### 🔄 Hook Equivalent in Functional Components

In functional components, you achieve the same effect using `useEffect` with a **cleanup function**:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => console.log("Tick"), 1000);

  return () => {
    clearInterval(interval); // cleanup on unmount
    console.log("Cleaned up");
  };
}, []);
```

---

### 📌 Summary

- `componentWillUnmount()` is used to handle **cleanup** before a class component is destroyed.
- It helps in preventing **memory leaks**, stale subscriptions, or dangling side effects.
- In **modern React**, functional components use `useEffect`'s cleanup mechanism for the same purpose.
