Here are the **most commonly asked SQL interview questions with clear answers** on:

> ✅ `GROUP BY`  
> ✅ `HAVING`  
> ✅ Subqueries  
— tailored for **Java Full Stack Developer (7+ YOE)** interviews like Wipro, TCS, Infosys, and product companies.

## ✅ 1. What is `GROUP BY` in SQL?

**Answer:**  
`GROUP BY` is used to **group rows that have the same values** in specified columns into summary rows.  
It is **typically used with aggregate functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;
```
➡️ Groups all employees by department and counts how many in each.

---

## ✅ 2. What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?

| Clause   | Applies to       | Used For                            |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `WHERE`  | Individual rows  | Filters **before grouping**         |
| `HAVING` | Grouped results  | Filters **after grouping**          |

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

- `WHERE status = 'active'` filters rows **before** grouping  
- `HAVING COUNT(*) > 5` filters groups **after**

---

## ✅ 3. Can you use `HAVING` without `GROUP BY`?

**Yes**, but it's rare. You can use `HAVING` on aggregated results even without grouping:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM employees
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

---

## ✅ 4. What is a Subquery?

**Answer:**  
A subquery is a **query nested inside another query**. It returns data used by the outer query.

Types:
- **Scalar Subquery**: returns a single value
- **Row Subquery**: returns one row (multiple columns)
- **Table Subquery**: returns multiple rows (used with `IN`, `EXISTS`, joins)

---

## ✅ 5. Example of a Scalar Subquery

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

→ Returns all employees whose salary is above the average.

---

## ✅ 6. Difference between `IN`, `EXISTS`, and `=` in subqueries?

| Operator | Use Case                       | Performance (General)   |
|----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `=`      | Scalar subquery (1 value)      | Fast for single value   |
| `IN`     | Compare against multiple values| May be slow on large sets |
| `EXISTS` | Checks for row existence       | Faster for correlated queries |

---

## ✅ 7. What is a Correlated Subquery?

**Answer:**  
A correlated subquery refers to **columns of the outer query**, and is **executed once per outer row**.

```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM employees e
WHERE salary > (
  SELECT AVG(salary)
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = e.department
);
```

→ Gets employees earning above their own department’s average.

---

## ✅ 8. Can we use a subquery in `FROM` clause?

**Yes** — it's called a **derived table** or **inline view**.

```sql
SELECT dept, avg_salary
FROM (
  SELECT department AS dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
) AS dept_avg
WHERE avg_salary > 50000;
```

---

## ✅ 9. Can `GROUP BY` be used with multiple columns?

**Yes**, you can group by more than one column.

```sql
SELECT department, role, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department, role;
```

➡️ Groups by both `department` and `role`.

---

## ✅ 10. What happens if you select a column not in `GROUP BY` or aggregate?

It will cause an error in strict SQL engines (like PostgreSQL). In MySQL (non-strict mode), it may return unpredictable results.

**Correct:**
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

**Incorrect:**
```sql
SELECT department, name, COUNT(*)   -- ❌ name is neither grouped nor aggregated
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
