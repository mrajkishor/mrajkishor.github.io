### **Mastering SQL Aggregate Functions and Clauses: MIN, MAX, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY**

SQL is a versatile language that offers powerful features for data manipulation and analysis. Among its many tools, aggregate functions like `MIN`, `MAX`, and `DISTINCT`, and clauses like `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` are indispensable for summarizing, filtering, and organizing data.

This blog provides a detailed explanation of these SQL features with real-world examples.

---

### **1. MIN and MAX**

#### **Definition**
- **`MIN`**: Finds the smallest value in a column.
- **`MAX`**: Finds the largest value in a column.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name), MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

#### **Example**: Find the minimum and maximum salaries of employees.

**Employees Table**:

| EmployeeID | Name      | Department | Salary  |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 1          | Alice     | HR         | 50000   |
| 2          | Bob       | IT         | 60000   |
| 3          | Charlie   | Finance    | 55000   |
| 4          | Diana     | HR         | 45000   |

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT MIN(Salary) AS MinimumSalary, MAX(Salary) AS MaximumSalary
FROM Employees;
```

**Result**:

| MinimumSalary | MaximumSalary |
|---------------|---------------|
| 45000         | 60000         |

---

### **2. DISTINCT**

#### **Definition**
- **`DISTINCT`**: Eliminates duplicate values from the result set and returns only unique values.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;
```

#### **Example**: List all unique departments.

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Department
FROM Employees;
```

**Result**:

| Department |
|------------|
| HR         |
| IT         |
| Finance    |

---

### **3. GROUP BY**

#### **Definition**
- **`GROUP BY`**: Groups rows with the same values into summary rows, often used with aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

#### **Example**: Find the total salary for each department.

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

**Result**:

| Department | TotalSalary |
|------------|-------------|
| HR         | 95000       |
| IT         | 60000       |
| Finance    | 55000       |

---

### **4. HAVING**

#### **Definition**
- **`HAVING`**: Filters groups based on conditions. Unlike `WHERE`, it is used with aggregate functions.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;
```

#### **Example**: Find departments with total salaries greater than 55,000.

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING SUM(Salary) > 55000;
```

**Result**:

| Department | TotalSalary |
|------------|-------------|
| HR         | 95000       |
| IT         | 60000       |

---

### **5. ORDER BY**

#### **Definition**
- **`ORDER BY`**: Sorts the result set in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC];
```

#### **Example**: List employees by salary in descending order.

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT Name, Salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

**Result**:

| Name      | Salary  |
|-----------|---------|
| Bob       | 60000   |
| Charlie   | 55000   |
| Alice     | 50000   |
| Diana     | 45000   |

### **Combining MIN, MAX, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY**

#### **Scenario**: Perform the following tasks:
1. Group employees by department.
2. Calculate the minimum, maximum, and total salaries for each department.
3. Include only departments with total salaries above 55,000.
4. Sort the results by total salary in descending order.

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT Department, 
       MIN(Salary) AS MinimumSalary, 
       MAX(Salary) AS MaximumSalary, 
       SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING SUM(Salary) > 55000
ORDER BY TotalSalary DESC;
```

**Result**:

| Department | MinimumSalary | MaximumSalary | TotalSalary |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| HR         | 45000         | 50000         | 95000       |
| IT         | 60000         | 60000         | 60000       |

### **Advanced Use Case: COUNT with DISTINCT**

#### **Scenario**: Count the number of unique departments.

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Department) AS UniqueDepartments
FROM Employees;
```

**Result**:

| UniqueDepartments |
|--------------------|
| 3                  |

### **Best Practices**

1. **Filter Early with WHERE**:
   - Use `WHERE` to filter rows before grouping to reduce computation overhead.

2. **Use HAVING for Aggregates**:
   - Use `HAVING` to filter groups based on aggregate function results.

3. **Combine with ORDER BY**:
   - Use `ORDER BY` to sort results for better readability or ranking.

4. **Optimize with Indexes**:
   - Use indexes on columns used in `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `WHERE` for better performance.

5. **Validate Data with DISTINCT**:
   - Use `DISTINCT` to check for duplicates and ensure data consistency.

### **Conclusion**

SQL's aggregate functions (`MIN`, `MAX`, `DISTINCT`) and clauses (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`) are essential tools for summarizing, filtering, and organizing data. By mastering these features, you can efficiently analyze and manipulate datasets for various business and technical needs.
