### 📘 Redis – Distributed Locks (`SETNX`, Redlock Algorithm)

Distributed systems often need **mutual exclusion**—ensuring that **only one process** can access a critical section at a time across multiple machines or threads. Redis provides a simple, fast, and effective solution for implementing **distributed locks**, primarily using the `SETNX` command and more robustly using the **Redlock algorithm**.

---

## 🔹 1. What is a Distributed Lock?

A **distributed lock** allows processes running on different servers to safely coordinate access to a shared resource (e.g., updating the same record in a database).

### ✅ Properties of a Good Distributed Lock:

* **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one client can hold the lock.
* **Deadlock Safety**: Locks should expire to prevent stuck states.
* **Fault Tolerance**: System should still function despite crashes.
* **Timeliness**: Locks should have a TTL (auto-expiry).

---

## 🔹 2. Basic Locking with `SETNX`

### 🔧 Command:

```bash
SETNX lock:key "client-id"
```

* `SETNX` = SET if Not eXists

### ✅ Usage:

```bash
SETNX lock:order:123 "process-1"
```

* Returns `1` if the lock was acquired, `0` if already held.

### 🧨 Problem:

* **No expiry** → If the process crashes, the lock may never be released.

---

## 🔹 3. Safer Locking with `SET` + `NX` + `PX`

### ✅ Improved command:

```bash
SET lock:key "client-id" NX PX 5000
```

* `NX`: Only set if key doesn’t exist
* `PX`: Set TTL in milliseconds (e.g., 5000 ms = 5s)
* Prevents **deadlocks** and ensures **auto-expiry**

### 🧪 Example:

```bash
SET lock:invoice:999 "process-42" NX PX 10000
```

---

## 🔹 4. Releasing the Lock Safely

You must **only release a lock if your process owns it** to avoid deleting someone else’s lock.

### ✅ Use Lua script for atomic check-and-delete:

```lua
if redis.call("get", KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then
    return redis.call("del", KEYS[1])
else
    return 0
end
```

### Executed in Redis:

```bash
EVAL "<above-lua-script>" 1 lock:invoice:999 "process-42"
```

## 🔹 5. Redlock Algorithm – Redis Distributed Locking at Scale

Created by **Salvatore Sanfilippo** (Redis creator), Redlock is a **robust, fault-tolerant distributed locking algorithm** suitable for **multi-node Redis clusters**.

### 🛠 Redlock Setup:

* Use **N Redis instances** (typically 5).
* Each process attempts to acquire the lock in a **majority of instances** (e.g., 3 of 5).
* The lock is acquired **only if a quorum** is achieved within a small time window (say 100 ms).
* If acquired, a TTL is associated with the lock.
* The lock is **released** by sending delete commands to all instances.

---

### ✅ Redlock Acquisition Steps:

1. Get current timestamp in milliseconds.
2. Try to acquire the lock using `SET NX PX` in each Redis instance.
3. If the lock is acquired in the **majority** of instances, and within a limited time (TTL – safety factor), consider it successful.
4. If unsuccessful, release locks acquired so far.
5. When done, delete the key in all instances.

## 🔐 Lock Identifier (UUID)

Always store a **unique identifier** (like a UUID) with the lock to identify ownership when releasing it. Never release a lock you don’t own.

```bash
SET lock:key "uuid-123" NX PX 5000
```

## 📋 Summary: Key Commands

| Command                 | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `SETNX key val`         | Basic lock (unsafe if no TTL)    |
| `SET key val NX PX ttl` | Safe lock with TTL               |
| `GET key`               | Check lock value                 |
| `DEL key`               | Delete the lock (manual release) |
| `EVAL script`           | Atomically release only if owner |

## 🧠 Use Cases of Redis Distributed Locks

| Use Case                             | Why Lock is Needed                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Prevent duplicate payment processing | Ensure only one transaction is triggered   |
| Scheduling tasks                     | Only one worker should run a job           |
| Inventory stock update               | Avoid overselling or duplicate orders      |
| Message deduplication                | Prevent multiple consumers processing same |

## ✅ Final Thoughts

Redis provides an elegant and fast way to implement distributed locks:

* For **simple cases**, use `SET key val NX PX`.
* For **high-availability, multi-node systems**, use **Redlock**.
* Always ensure you **release locks safely** using unique identifiers.

🔐 Distributed locking is a **critical tool in microservices and concurrent systems**, and Redis makes it efficient and reliable.
