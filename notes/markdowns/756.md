## üß† Introduction to CPU

The **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**, also called a **processor** or **microprocessor**, is the **brain of the computer**. It is responsible for executing instructions from both hardware and software, performing all critical processing tasks. It manages input and output device communication, handles logical and mathematical operations, and stores vital programs like the operating system and applications.

The CPU is installed in a **CPU socket** on the **motherboard** and usually paired with a **heat sink** to dissipate heat and maintain optimal performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Does a CPU Do?

The CPU performs millions of instructions per second, although only one at a time. It follows a **four-step instruction cycle**:

1. **Fetch** ‚Äì Retrieves instructions from memory (RAM).
2. **Decode** ‚Äì Translates instructions into binary/machine language.
3. **Execute** ‚Äì Performs the operation using its components.
4. **Store** ‚Äì Writes the result back to memory (RAM).

Example input devices: keyboard, mouse, microphone

Example output devices: display screen, printer

## üß© Main Components of CPU

### 1. **Control Unit (CU)**

* Coordinates all CPU operations using electrical signals
* Decodes instructions and directs data flow within CPU
* Does *not* process or store data

### 2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**

* Performs arithmetic (add, subtract, etc.) and logical operations (compare, AND, OR)
* Can include timers and support for multiple ALUs in high-performance CPUs

### 3. **Registers / Memory Unit**

* Short-term storage for instructions, data, and intermediate results
* Commonly refers to **RAM (Random Access Memory)** for holding active programs and data temporarily

## üß¨ Types of CPUs

### üîπ **Single Core CPU**

* One core processes one task at a time
* Multitasking is slow due to context switching
* Mostly obsolete except in very basic devices

### üîπ **Dual Core CPU**

* Two cores within a single chip
* Better multitasking than single core
* Each core has its own cache and works in parallel

### üîπ **Quad Core CPU**

* Four independent cores on one chip
* Can handle multiple tasks or threads simultaneously
* Ideal for modern multitasking and parallel computing

## üè≠ CPU Manufacturers

* **Intel** and **AMD** are the two major CPU manufacturers
* Both produce a wide range of processors for desktops, laptops, and mobile devices
