# 📦 Understanding Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volumes

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. These volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices that can be mounted and used just like a hard drive. Let’s explore what EBS volumes are, how they work, and best practices to manage them.

## 🧠 What is an EBS Volume?

An **EBS Volume** is essentially a **network-based drive** that you can attach to your EC2 instance for storing data persistently—even after the instance has been terminated.

### ✅ Key Characteristics:
- **Persistent Storage**: Data persists beyond the life of an EC2 instance.
- **Network-Attached**: EBS volumes use the AWS network to communicate with your EC2 instance.
- **Single Attachment**: A volume can be attached to **only one EC2 instance at a time** at the **Availability Zone (AZ)** level.
- **Availability Zone Bound**: It is **tied to a specific AZ**, so an EBS volume in `us-east-1a` cannot be directly attached to an EC2 instance in `us-east-1b`.

### 💡 Analogy:
Think of it as a **“network USB stick”**—you plug it into your EC2 instance, use it, unplug it, and reuse it elsewhere (in the same AZ).

## 🌍 EBS Volume as a Network Drive

Unlike physical drives:
- EBS volumes **communicate over the network**, which may introduce slight latency.
- They can be **quickly detached** and **re-attached** to other EC2 instances within the same AZ.

---

## 🔐 Availability Zone Lock-In

EBS volumes are locked to their **Availability Zone**:
- An EBS volume in `us-east-1a` **cannot** be attached to an instance in `us-east-1b`.
- To move a volume to a different AZ, you must **create a snapshot** and **restore it** in the desired AZ.

---

## 📏 Provisioned Capacity

EBS volumes are **provisioned with a fixed size and performance**, defined in:
- **Gigabytes (GB)** for storage
- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)** for performance

You are **billed** for the **entire provisioned capacity**, not just the data used. However, AWS allows you to **increase capacity over time** if needed.

## 📊 EBS Volume – Example

Let’s say you have EC2 instances and volumes in two Availability Zones:

```
US-EAST-1A:
  - EC2 #1 ↔ EBS 10 GB
  - EC2 #2 ↔ EBS 100 GB + EBS 50 GB

US-EAST-1B:
  - EC2 #3 ↔ EBS 50 GB
  - EBS 10 GB (unattached)
```

This diagram shows that EBS volumes can be shared among EC2 instances (one at a time), but only within the same Availability Zone.

## 🗑 EBS – Delete on Termination Attribute

EBS volumes have a **"Delete on Termination"** setting, which defines what happens when an EC2 instance is terminated:

### 🔧 Default Behavior:
- **Root volume**: Deleted on termination (enabled by default)
- **Additional volumes**: Not deleted on termination (disabled by default)

You can control this behavior using the **AWS Management Console** or **AWS CLI**.

### 🧰 Use Case:
If you want to **preserve the root volume** of your instance (e.g., for forensic analysis or backup), you should **disable the "Delete on Termination"** flag.

## 🎁 Free Tier Information

- AWS provides **30 GB of EBS storage** under the free tier each month.
- You can use it with **General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3)** or **Magnetic volumes**.
