### 🔢 8.1 Algebraic Structures: Definition and Properties

---

### ✅ What is an Algebraic Structure?

An **algebraic structure** is simply a **non-empty set** of elements, combined with one or more **binary operations**.

> If you have a set **G** and a binary operation `*`, the structure is written as **(G, \*)**.

This just means: “I have a bunch of elements, and I can combine any two of them using some rule — like +, ×, etc.”

---

### 📌 Example:

Let’s say
**S = {1, -1}**

Now apply multiplication (\*):

* 1 × 1 = 1
* 1 × (-1) = -1
* (-1) × (-1) = 1

✅ All results belong to S → So it **is** an algebraic structure under multiplication.

But under addition (+):

* 1 + (-1) = 0 → ❌ 0 is **not** in S → So **not** a structure under +.

---

### 🧠 Important Properties of Algebraic Structures

To qualify as an algebraic structure under a binary operation `*`, the following properties may be checked:

---

#### 1. **Closure**

If combining any two elements in the set using the operation `*` still gives a result **within the same set**, the set is closed under `*`.

> (a \* b) ∈ S, for all a, b ∈ S

---

#### 2. **Commutativity**

If the order of operation doesn’t matter:

> a \* b = b \* a for all a, b in the set

Then `*` is **commutative** in G.

---

#### 3. **Associativity**

If grouping doesn’t affect the result:

> (a \* b) \* c = a \* (b \* c)

Then `*` is **associative** in G.

---

#### 4. **Identity Element**

If there exists an element **e** in G such that:

> a \* e = e \* a = a

Then **e** is the **identity element**. It doesn’t change other elements when used in the operation.

---

#### 5. **Inverse Element**

If for every element **a**, there exists another element **a⁻¹** (also in G) such that:

> a \* a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ \* a = e
> (where **e** is the identity)

Then **a⁻¹** is called the **inverse of a**.

---

#### 6. **Cancellation Law**

If:

* **Left Cancellation**: a \* b = a \* c → b = c
* **Right Cancellation**: b \* a = c \* a → b = c

Then cancellation laws hold in the set.

---

### 🧩 Types of Algebraic Structures

Based on how many of the above properties are satisfied, algebraic structures are classified into the following types:

---

#### 🔸 **Semigroup**

* Set with a binary operation that is **associative**
* No need for identity or inverse

---

#### 🔸 **Monoid**

* **Semigroup + identity element**
* Still doesn't require inverses

---

#### 🔸 **Group**

* **Monoid + inverse for every element**
* Has associativity, identity, and inverses

---

#### 🔸 **Abelian Group**

* A **group** that is also **commutative**
* So all properties: closure, associativity, identity, inverse, and commutativity

---

### 🎯 Where Are These Used?

Algebraic structures aren’t just abstract theory. They’re used in:

* **Binary coding**
* **Cryptography**
* **Computer Science algorithms**
* **Group theory in math and physics**

---

| Structure     | Associative | Identity | Inverse | Commutative |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |

## 📘 Chapter 8.2: Types of Algebraic Structures — Human Notes

---

### ✅ 1. Semigroup

A **Semigroup** is the most basic algebraic structure. It has:

* **Closure**: If `a * b` is in the set for all a, b
* **Associativity**: (a \* b) \* c = a \* (b \* c)

That’s it! No need for identity or inverse.

🧠 **Example**:

* (Integers, +)
* (Matrices, ×)

---

### ✅ 2. Monoid

A **Monoid** is just a **Semigroup with Identity**.

So, it must have:

* Closure ✅
* Associativity ✅
* **Identity**: There is some `e` such that `a * e = e * a = a`

🧠 **Example**:

* (Whole numbers, +) → Identity is 0
* (Positive integers, ×) → Identity is 1
* But (Natural numbers, +) is **not** a monoid because no identity (0 not in N)

---

### ✅ 3. Group

A **Group** is a **Monoid** with one more thing: **Inverse**.

So, a Group has:

* Closure ✅
* Associativity ✅
* Identity ✅
* **Inverse**: For every `a`, there is `a⁻¹` such that `a * a⁻¹ = e`

🧠 **Example**:

* (Integers, +) → Inverse of 3 is -3
* (Non-zero real numbers, ×) → Inverse of 2 is ½

---

### ✅ 4. Abelian Group (Commutative Group)

An **Abelian Group** is a **Group** where order doesn’t matter.

So it has:

* All **Group properties**
* **Commutative**: a \* b = b \* a

🧠 **Examples**:

* (Z, +) → Abelian
* (Matrix multiplication) → ❌ Not Abelian

---

| Structure     | Closure | Assoc. | Identity | Inverse | Commutative |
| ------------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Semigroup     | ✅       | ✅      | ❌        | ❌       | ❌           |
| Monoid        | ✅       | ✅      | ✅        | ❌       | ❌           |

| Abelian Group | ✅       | ✅      | ✅        | ✅       | ✅           |

---

### ✅ 5. Subgroup

A **Subgroup** is a **subset** of a group that is also a group.

Let G be a group and H ⊆ G. If H itself forms a group under the same operation, it’s a subgroup.

**Types of Subgroups**:

* **Trivial subgroup**: Just the identity element `{e}`
* **Proper subgroup**: H ≠ G, but still a group

🧠 **Useful Rules**:

* H is a subgroup ⇔ a, b ∈ H ⇒ ab⁻¹ ∈ H
* H ∩ K is always a subgroup
* H ∪ K is a subgroup only if one is subset of the other

---

### ✅ 6. Cyclic Group

If you can generate a group by **repeated application of a single element**, it’s called a **Cyclic Group**.

Let G = ⟨x⟩
This means: G = {x, x², x³, ..., xⁿ = I}
(where I is identity)

Cyclic groups are **always Abelian**.

🧠 Notation:

* Cₙ or Zₙ for a cyclic group of order n

---

### ✅ 7. Factor Group (Quotient Group)

Let G be a group and N a **normal subgroup** of G.

The **set of cosets** `G/N` forms a new group called the **Factor Group** or **Quotient Group**.

* Each element in G/N is of the form: aN
* If G uses addition, we write a + N

🧠 Factor Group = Group of Cosets

---

### ✅ 8. Permutation Groups

A **Permutation** is a **one-to-one and onto** mapping from a set to itself.

If G is a set with n elements:

* **Sₙ (or Pₙ)** = All possible permutations of G
* Total permutations = **n!**

This group of permutations is also known as the **Symmetric Group**.

🧠 Example:

* S₃ has 3! = 6 permutations

## 📘 Chapter 8.3: Normal Subgroup — Human Notes

---

### 🧠 What is a Normal Subgroup?

In simple terms, a **normal subgroup** is a special type of subgroup where the group operation "behaves nicely" when elements are moved around by conjugation.

A subgroup **N** of group **G** is **normal** if:

> For every `g ∈ G` and `n ∈ N`,
> `g * n * g⁻¹ ∈ N`

📌 This is called **conjugation** — you're applying `g`, then `n`, then undoing `g`.

We denote a normal subgroup as:
**N ⫳ G** or **N ◁ G** (pronounced "N is normal in G")

---

### ✅ Examples

1. **N = {1}** is a normal subgroup of **G = {1, -1}**,
   since:
   `1 * 1 * 1⁻¹ = 1 ∈ N` and
   `-1 * 1 * (-1)⁻¹ = -1 * 1 * -1 = 1 ∈ N`

2. **N = {1, -1}** is normal in **G = {1, -1, i, -i}**

3. **{e}** — the identity alone — is always a normal subgroup

4. If **left coset = right coset**, i.e., `gN = Ng` for all `g`,
   then N is a normal subgroup

---

### 📌 Special Notes:

* If **every subgroup** of a group is normal, and the group is **not abelian**, then it's called a **Hamiltonian group**.
* The group itself (**G**) and the identity-only set (**{e}**) are called **improper normal subgroups**.
* Any other normal subgroup is called a **proper normal subgroup**.
* A group that has **no proper normal subgroup** (other than G and {e}) is called a **simple group**.
* **Intersection** of two normal subgroups is also normal.
* In **cyclic groups**, all subgroups are automatically normal.

---

### 📖 Theorem 1 – Every Subgroup of an Abelian Group is Normal

**Proof:**

Let G be abelian, and N a subgroup of G.

Take `g ∈ G` and `n ∈ N`. Then:

```
g * n * g⁻¹ = n * g * g⁻¹     (since G is abelian → commutative)
            = n * e
            = n ∈ N
```

✅ So, `g * n * g⁻¹ ∈ N` for all `g ∈ G, n ∈ N`.
Hence, every subgroup of an abelian group is **normal**.

---

### 📖 Theorem 2 – gNg⁻¹ = N ⇔ N is a Normal Subgroup

**To Prove**:
A subgroup N of G is normal ⇔ `gNg⁻¹ = N` for all `g ∈ G`.

---

#### **Proof (⇒ direction)**:

Assume N is a normal subgroup of G.
So for all `g ∈ G`, `n ∈ N`:

```
g * n * g⁻¹ ∈ N
→ gNg⁻¹ ⊆ N          … (1)
```

Now apply the same logic to `g⁻¹ ∈ G`:

```
g⁻¹ * n * g ∈ N
→ g⁻¹Ng ⊆ N
→ g(g⁻¹Ng)g⁻¹ ⊆ gNg⁻¹
→ N ⊆ gNg⁻¹           … (2)
```

From (1) and (2):
`gNg⁻¹ = N`

---

#### **Proof (⇐ direction)**:

Assume:
`gNg⁻¹ = N` for all `g ∈ G`

Then for any `n ∈ N`,
→ `g * n * g⁻¹ ∈ N`

✅ Hence, N is a **normal subgroup** of G.

## 📘 Chapter 8.4: Cosets and Lagrange’s Theorem — Human Notes

---

### ✳️ 8.4.1 Cosets

A **coset** is a way of grouping elements in a group based on a subgroup.

Let **H** be a **subgroup** of a group **G**.
If **g ∈ G**, then:

* **Left coset** of H:  `gH = { g * h | h ∈ H }`
* **Right coset** of H: `Hg = { h * g | h ∈ H }`

These cosets are just "translations" of the subgroup across the group G.

---

### 🧠 Example (Cosets in Z₄ under +):

Let **G = Z₄ = {0, 1, 2, 3}**, and subgroup **H = {0, 2}**
We find the left cosets of H in G:

* `0 + H = {0 + 0, 0 + 2} = {0, 2}`
* `1 + H = {1 + 0, 1 + 2} = {1, 3}`
* `2 + H = {2 + 0, 2 + 2} = {2, 0} = {0, 2}`
* `3 + H = {3 + 0, 3 + 2} = {3, 1} = {1, 3}`

So, there are **two distinct cosets**:
→ `{0, 2}` and `{1, 3}`

---

### ✴️ Important Coset Facts

* Each coset contains **|H| elements**, same as the subgroup
* **All cosets are disjoint** (no overlap)
* Every element of G is in **exactly one coset**
* The **number of cosets** = **index of H in G** = |G| ÷ |H|

---

### 📘 8.4.2 Lagrange’s Theorem

One of the most important theorems in group theory!

---

### 🧾 Statement:

> **In any finite group G, the order (size) of any subgroup H divides the order of G.**

Mathematically:
If G is finite, and H ≤ G, then:
    `|G| = [G : H] × |H|`
(Where \[G : H] is the **index** = number of distinct cosets of H in G)

---

### 🔍 Lemmas Used in the Proof:

1. ✅ **Lemma 1**: Each coset has a one-to-one match with elements of H (same size).
2. ✅ **Lemma 2**: "g₁H = g₂H" defines an **equivalence relation** on G.
3. ✅ **Lemma 3**: If two equivalence classes overlap, they are identical.

---

### ✅ Proof Sketch:

Let:

* G has **m elements**
* H has **n elements**
* Total number of distinct left cosets of H in G = **p**

So:

* Each coset has **n elements**
* Total elements in G = `n × p` = `|H| × [G:H]`

Therefore,
    `|G| = n × p`
    → `|H| divides |G|`

✅ Hence proved!

---

### 🎯 Examples of Cosets + Lagrange's Theorem

Let G = Z₆ = {0,1,2,3,4,5}, and H = {0,3}

Then:

* Cosets:

  * 0 + H = {0,3}
  * 1 + H = {1,4}
  * 2 + H = {2,5}

So:

* |G| = 6
* |H| = 2
* Number of cosets = 3 → 6 ÷ 2 = 3 ✅

---

### 📌 Lagrange's Theorem Corollaries

---

#### **Corollary 1**:

In a finite group G, the **order of any element a ∈ G** divides the order of the group.

Proof:

* Let order of a = p ⇒ `aᵖ = e`
* Elements: `a, a², ..., aᵖ = e` form a subgroup
* So p divides |G|
* Hence, `a^|G| = e`

✅ Important result: `a^m = e`, where m = order of G

---

#### **Corollary 2**:

If the order of G is a **prime number**, then it has **no proper subgroups**.

Proof:

* A prime number has only two divisors: 1 and itself
* So only subgroups: `{e}` and G
  ✅ No proper subgroup possible

---

#### **Corollary 3**:

A group of **prime order** is always a **cyclic group**.

Proof:

* Let G be of prime order p
* Take any `a ≠ e` in G
* Order of a divides p ⇒ must be p
* So the subgroup generated by a = G itself
  ✅ So G is cyclic

---

## 📘 Chapter 8.5: Homomorphism & Isomorphism of Groups — Human Notes

---

### 🔄 What Is a Group Homomorphism?

A **group homomorphism** is a special kind of function between two groups that **respects the group operation**.

Let:

* $(G, \ast)$ and $(H, \triangle)$ be two groups
* $f: G \to H$ be a function from group G to group H

Then **f is called a group homomorphism** if:

$$
f(x \ast y) = f(x) \triangle f(y), \quad \forall x, y \in G
$$

🧠 **In simple terms**:
A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two groups. It keeps the operation consistent between the groups.

---

### ✳️ Example:

Let G = (Z, +), H = (2Z, +)
Define $f(x) = 2x$

Then for all x, y ∈ Z:

$$
f(x + y) = 2(x + y) = 2x + 2y = f(x) + f(y)
$$

✅ So f is a group homomorphism from Z to 2Z.

---

### 🔁 What Is a Group Isomorphism?

A **group isomorphism** is a **bijective (one-to-one and onto)** homomorphism.

So:

* It’s a homomorphism **f: G → H**
* **f is bijective** (each element of G matches with exactly one element in H, and vice versa)

✅ If such a function exists, we say:

$$
G \cong H \quad \text{(G is isomorphic to H)}
$$

🧠 **Meaning**:
G and H are essentially the "same" in structure — just written differently.

---

| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Homomorphism | Map between two groups that preserves the group operation               |
| Isomorphism  | A **bijective** homomorphism (both structure-preserving and reversible) |
| f(x ∗ y)     | = f(x) △ f(y) — key condition for a homomorphism                        |
| G ≅ H        | G and H are structurally identical (isomorphic groups)                  |

---

### 🧠 Tip to Remember

If a function **just preserves operation** → it's a **homomorphism**
If it's also **bijective** (no duplicates, nothing left out) → it's an **isomorphism**
