---

## 1. Introduction to Conceptual Design

* **Conceptual Database Design** is the **first phase** of database design.
* The goal is to create a **high-level description** of the data and relationships in a system, independent of implementation.
* This is usually expressed using the **Entity‚ÄìRelationship (ER) Model**.

**Why Conceptual Design?**

* Ensures all **user requirements** are captured.
* Provides a **clear communication tool** between database designers and business stakeholders.
* Acts as a **blueprint** for logical and physical design.

## 2. Steps in Conceptual Database Design

### 2.1 Identify Entities

* Look for **nouns** in the problem domain (e.g., Employee, Branch, Property).
* Entities represent real-world objects to be stored in the database.

### 2.2 Identify Relationships

* Determine how entities are **related** to each other.
* Example: `EMPLOYEE works-for BRANCH`, `CLIENT rents PROPERTY`.

### 2.3 Identify Attributes

* Entities and relationships have **descriptive properties**.
* Example:

  * Employee: EmpNo, Name, Salary.
  * Property: PropertyNo, Address, Rent.

### 2.4 Determine Keys

* Each entity must have a **primary key** to uniquely identify instances.
* Example: Employee(EmpNo), Property(PropertyNo).

### 2.5 Identify Constraints

* Cardinalities: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.
* Participation: total or partial.

### 2.6 Create the ER Diagram

* Graphical representation:

  * Entities = rectangles
  * Relationships = diamonds
  * Attributes = ovals
  * Primary key = underlined

## 3. CASE STUDY: DreamHome Example

DreamHome is a property rental organization used throughout the book.

### Entities

* **Branch** (BranchNo, Address, TelNo)
* **Staff** (StaffNo, Name, Position, Salary)
* **PropertyForRent** (PropertyNo, Address, Rent)
* **Client** (ClientNo, Name, MaxRent)
* **Owner** (OwnerNo, Name, Address)

### Relationships

* `Branch` employs `Staff` (1-to-many).
* `Staff` manages `PropertyForRent` (1-to-many).
* `Client` views `PropertyForRent` (many-to-many).
* `Owner` owns `PropertyForRent` (1-to-many).

### ER Diagram Features

* Includes **keys** for each entity.
* Relationships with **cardinality constraints** (1\:N, M\:N).
* Attributes attached to entities and some relationships (e.g., ‚ÄúviewDate‚Äù in `Client-Views-Property`).

## 4. Dealing with Complex Situations

### 4.1 Weak Entities

* Entities that **cannot be uniquely identified** without another entity.
* Example: `Dependent` depends on `Employee`.

### 4.2 Recursive Relationships

* Entity related to itself.
* Example: `Staff supervises Staff`.

### 4.3 Ternary Relationships

* Relationships involving three entities.
* Example: `Client views Property with Staff`.

---

## 5. Validating the ER Model

* Ensure it meets **user requirements**.
* Check **consistency** with real-world rules.
* Example: ‚ÄúEvery property must be owned by exactly one owner.‚Äù

---

## 6. Deliverables of Conceptual Design

* **ER Diagram** for the system.
* A **data dictionary** describing entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints.
* A clear understanding of **business rules** and how they map to database structures.

## üîë Key Takeaways

1. **Conceptual design** is about modeling data requirements using the **ER model** before moving to implementation.
2. Steps: Identify **entities, relationships, attributes, keys, constraints** ‚Üí create ER diagram.
3. **DreamHome example** illustrates how to capture a rental agency‚Äôs data needs.
4. Must handle **weak entities, recursive & ternary relationships** carefully.
5. Output: **ER diagram + data dictionary**, validated against business requirements.
