## **ArrayList – Internal Structure, Resizing Strategy**

---

### 🔷 Introduction

`ArrayList` is one of the most commonly used classes in the **Java Collections Framework**. It implements the `List` interface and provides a **dynamic array** that grows as needed. While easy to use on the surface, its **internal architecture, resizing strategy, and performance characteristics** are crucial for high-performance systems — especially at **Enterprise scale** where collections might hold millions of elements.

---

## 🔹 1. What is `ArrayList`?

* Part of `java.util`
* Implements: `List`, `RandomAccess`, `Cloneable`, `Serializable`
* Provides:

  * Constant-time positional access
  * Dynamic resizing
  * Fast iteration
  * Non-synchronized behavior (not thread-safe)

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

---

## 🔹 2. Internal Data Structure

Internally, `ArrayList` is backed by a **resizable array** of `Object[]`:

```java
transient Object[] elementData; // NOT private for performance access
```

* `size`: Tracks the number of actual elements (not array length)
* `elementData.length`: The capacity (physical size of backing array)

> 📌 This array is dynamically resized when needed. The resizing logic and capacity growth are core to understanding its performance.

---

## 🔹 3. ArrayList Growth and Resizing Strategy

### 🔸 Initial Capacity

* Default constructor (`new ArrayList<>()`) initializes with **empty array**.
* On first `add()`, it initializes to default capacity **10**.
* Can also initialize explicitly:

  ```java
  new ArrayList<>(100); // Starts with capacity of 100
  ```

---

### 🔸 Growth Formula

When capacity is **exceeded**, `ArrayList` **grows by 50%**:

```java
newCapacity = oldCapacity + (oldCapacity >> 1); // i.e., 1.5x growth
```

🔧 Source:

```java
int oldCapacity = elementData.length;
int newCapacity = oldCapacity + (oldCapacity >> 1);
```

This keeps amortized cost of `add()` near **O(1)**.

---

### 🔸 Resizing Steps

1. Allocate a new array with `newCapacity`
2. Use `System.arraycopy()` to copy existing elements
3. Replace the old array reference with the new one

```java
elementData = Arrays.copyOf(elementData, newCapacity);
```

### 🔸 Worst-Case Time Complexity

* Resizing itself is **O(n)** due to array copying
* But **amortized** complexity of `add()` remains **O(1)**

> 🧠 **Enterprise Insight**: Know the trade-off between high growth factor (more memory) and frequent resizing (more CPU).

## 🔹 4. Time Complexity

| Operation             | Complexity                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `get(index)`          | O(1)                                         |
| `set(index, element)` | O(1)                                         |
| `add(element)`        | Amortized O(1), worst-case O(n) when resized |
| `add(index, element)` | O(n) (due to shifting)                       |
| `remove(index)`       | O(n) (due to shifting)                       |
| `contains()`          | O(n)                                         |
| `iterator()`          | O(n)                                         |

> ⚠️ Random access is fast, but insert/remove in the **middle** is expensive.

## 🔹 5. Memory Considerations

* Backing array may have **unused capacity**, leading to **wasted memory**
* Use `trimToSize()` to free unused memory:

  ```java
  arrayList.trimToSize();
  ```

> 🔥 **Enterprise Best Practice**: Use `ensureCapacity(n)` if you know the size beforehand to **prevent multiple resizes** during bulk addition.

---

## 🔹 6. Synchronization

* Not thread-safe by default
* Use:

  ```java
  List<E> syncList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
  ```
* Or prefer `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for **read-heavy** concurrent use

## 🔹 7. Constructors Overview

| Constructor                            | Description                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ArrayList()`                          | Default with lazy init of capacity 10     |
| `ArrayList(int initialCapacity)`       | For custom initial size                   |
| `ArrayList(Collection<? extends E> c)` | Creates and fills from another collection |

## 🧩 Final Enterprise Tip

* **Don't** use `ArrayList` for scenarios with frequent middle insertions/removals — use `LinkedList`.
* **Do** use `ArrayList` for high-throughput read-heavy tasks like:

  * Caching preprocessed data
  * Lookup tables
  * Queue-style processing (append-only)
