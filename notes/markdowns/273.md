### **Introduction to CompletableFuture in Java**

In modern software development, asynchronous programming is essential for building responsive, scalable, and efficient applications. Java introduced **`CompletableFuture`** in **Java 8** as part of the **`java.util.concurrent`** package, providing a more powerful and flexible approach to handling asynchronous programming than the traditional `Future` interface.

In this blog, weâ€™ll dive deep into `CompletableFuture`, explore its features, and provide practical examples to demonstrate how it simplifies asynchronous programming in Java.

### **What is CompletableFuture?**

`CompletableFuture` is a feature-rich, non-blocking API for handling asynchronous tasks in Java. It allows you to write cleaner and more maintainable asynchronous code by providing:
1. **Support for Functional Programming**: Works seamlessly with lambdas and streams.
2. **Chaining and Composition**: Combine multiple asynchronous tasks.
3. **Non-Blocking Execution**: Perform tasks without blocking the main thread.
4. **Exception Handling**: Gracefully handle errors in asynchronous workflows.

---

### **Key Features of CompletableFuture**

1. **Run Asynchronous Tasks**:
   - Use `runAsync()` and `supplyAsync()` to execute tasks asynchronously.

2. **Chaining Tasks**:
   - Use methods like `thenApply()`, `thenAccept()`, and `thenRun()` to process results and chain tasks.

3. **Combining Multiple Futures**:
   - Combine results of multiple asynchronous tasks using `thenCombine()` and `thenCompose()`.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle exceptions gracefully with methods like `exceptionally()` and `handle()`.

5. **Custom Executors**:
   - Use custom thread pools to manage task execution.

### **How CompletableFuture Works**

#### **Core Methods**

1. **Creating a CompletableFuture**:
   - `runAsync()`: Executes a task asynchronously but does not return a result.
   - `supplyAsync()`: Executes a task asynchronously and returns a result.

2. **Processing Results**:
   - `thenApply()`: Applies a function to the result.
   - `thenAccept()`: Consumes the result without returning anything.
   - `thenRun()`: Executes a task after completion without using the result.

3. **Combining Futures**:
   - `thenCompose()`: Chains dependent asynchronous tasks.
   - `thenCombine()`: Combines two independent tasks and processes their results.

4. **Handling Exceptions**:
   - `exceptionally()`: Provides a fallback value in case of an exception.
   - `handle()`: Handles results and exceptions together.

### **Examples of CompletableFuture**

#### **1. Running a Task Asynchronously**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Running an asynchronous task: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        // Wait for the task to complete
        future.join();
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Running an asynchronous task: ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1
```

---

#### **2. Returning a Result Asynchronously**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureWithResult {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            return "Hello, CompletableFuture!";
        });

        // Retrieve the result
        System.out.println(future.join());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, CompletableFuture!
```

---

#### **3. Chaining Tasks**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class ChainingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
                .thenApply(greeting -> greeting + ", CompletableFuture!")
                .thenAccept(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, CompletableFuture!
```

---

#### **4. Combining Two Futures**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CombiningFuturesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 20);
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 22);

        // Combine results of two futures
        CompletableFuture<Integer> result = future1.thenCombine(future2, Integer::sum);

        System.out.println("Combined result: " + result.join());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Combined result: 42
```

---

#### **5. Handling Exceptions**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            if (true) throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!");
            return 42;
        }).exceptionally(ex -> {
            System.out.println("Exception: " + ex.getMessage());
            return 0;
        });

        System.out.println("Result: " + future.join());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Exception: Something went wrong!
Result: 0
```

---

#### **6. Custom Executor**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class CustomExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task executed by custom thread pool: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }, Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2));

        future.join();
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Task executed by custom thread pool: pool-1-thread-1
```

### **When to Use CompletableFuture**

1. **Asynchronous Operations**:
   - Fetching data from APIs or databases without blocking the main thread.

2. **Parallel Computations**:
   - Execute multiple tasks concurrently and aggregate their results.

3. **Complex Workflows**:
   - Use `thenCompose()` and `thenCombine()` to manage dependencies between tasks.
