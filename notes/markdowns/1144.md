  Understand the role of `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and how they influence accessibility and SEO.

* **Forms and Input Controls**:
  Mastery over form elements, attributes (`autocomplete`, `required`, `pattern`, etc.), custom validation, native HTML validation APIs.

* **ARIA & Accessibility Attributes**:
  Using `aria-*`, `role`, `tabindex`, and how to build screen-reader-friendly UIs. Understand how semantic HTML reduces ARIA overhead.

* **SEO-Friendly Markup**:
  Proper use of headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), meta tags, `alt` attributes, `rel`, `canonical`, and Open Graph tags.

* **HTML5 APIs**:
  Geolocation, Web Storage (local/sessionStorage), Web Workers, WebSockets, Drag and Drop, Audio/Video embedding, Web Components.

* **Microdata & Schema.org**:
  Structured data for search engines — how to use JSON-LD or microdata with HTML to enhance discoverability.

* **Responsive & Adaptive Content**:
  Picture tags (`<picture>`, `srcset`, `sizes`), `<video>` fallbacks, and how to ensure HTML structure aids responsive behavior.

* **Performance & Rendering Optimization**:
  `defer`, `async`, `<link rel="preload">`, resource hints, ordering scripts/styles for first paint.

* **Forms with Accessibility**:
  Label association, input grouping (`<fieldset>`, `<legend>`), keyboard navigation, and dynamic ARIA updates.

## 🧩 Total Skill Count: ~170+  

This list is not only **exhaustive** for **frontend interviews at Enterprise**, but also helps you **structure your resume**, fill out **LinkedIn skills**, or build a **tech radar for self-assessment**.

## ✅ ==Why It’s Safe to Skip Angular==

### 1. **React Dominates in Product Companies**

* Enterprise and most high-paying startups use **React** for their web stack.
* Angular is more common in **enterprise services**, **government projects**, or **legacy corporate platforms**.

### 2. **Depth Beats Breadth**

* At 10 years of experience, recruiters expect you to be **deeply skilled in a chosen stack**, not just familiar with everything.
* Showing expertise in **React + Java (Spring Boot)** is far more valuable than shallow knowledge of both Angular and React.

### 3. **Tech Stack Alignment**

* You mentioned targeting **Java full stack** — most modern Java backends pair well with **React** for:

  * REST + React Query/Axios
  * Spring Boot + React with JWT/OAuth
  * Full-stack monorepos using Nx/Turbo for React + Java

---

## ⚠️ When You Might Still Need Angular (Rarely)

Only keep Angular if:

* The **job description explicitly lists it** as required.
* You're applying to **legacy banking/insurance/telecom clients** where Angular 8–14 is in use.
* You're in a service company that rotates developers across tech stacks.

---

## ✅ ==Recommendation==

If your resume or LinkedIn still shows Angular:

* Keep it under **"Past Tech Exposure"** or **“Also Familiar With”**.
* Don’t include it in your **core skillset or projects** unless directly relevant.
