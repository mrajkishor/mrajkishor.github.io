## **9.1 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

TCP is a **core transport layer protocol** in the TCP/IP model, enabling **reliable, connection-oriented communication** between devices across IP networks. It ensures the **accurate, complete, and sequential delivery** of data packets.

### ‚úÖ Key Features:

* **Connection Establishment**: Uses a **three-way handshake** (SYN ‚Üí SYN-ACK ‚Üí ACK) to establish a secure and synchronized connection before data transfer.
* **Reliability**:

  * Data is split into **segments** with **sequence numbers**.
  * Each segment is acknowledged by the receiver.
  * If an acknowledgment (ACK) is not received, **TCP retransmits** the segment.
* **Flow Control**: Ensures the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver using a **window size** mechanism.
* **Congestion Control**: Dynamically adjusts data flow using algorithms like **slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit**, and **fast recovery**.
* **Error Detection**: Uses **checksums** for segment integrity and handles packet loss via retransmission.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases:

TCP is ideal for:

* Web Browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Email (SMTP, IMAP)
* File Transfer (FTP)
* Remote Login (SSH)

## **9.2 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

UDP is a **connectionless, unreliable transport protocol** that provides **fast and lightweight data transmission** without ensuring delivery, order, or duplicate protection.

### ‚úÖ Key Features:

* **No Connection Setup**: Data is sent without establishing a connection.
* **Low Overhead**: Smaller header (8 bytes), no need for handshaking or acknowledgments.
* **No Guarantees**: Packets (datagrams) may be lost, duplicated, or received out of order.

### ‚úÖ Advantages:

* **Speed and Low Latency**: Ideal for time-sensitive applications.
* **Low Resource Consumption**: Suitable for devices with limited memory or processing power.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases:

* Real-time applications: VoIP (Voice over IP), video conferencing
* Online gaming
* DNS lookups
* Streaming media

> üîÅ Applications using UDP often implement their **own reliability mechanisms** if needed.

## **9.3 Routing Protocols**

Routing protocols are algorithms used by **routers** to determine the **best path** for forwarding data packets from source to destination across networks.

### ‚úÖ Major Types:

| Protocol                                               | Type            | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**                 | Distance-vector | Uses **hop count** as metric (max 15 hops), simple but slow convergence.                                            |
| **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**                    | Link-state      | Builds a **complete topology map**, uses **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** for best path. Faster and more scalable than RIP. |
| **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**                      | Path-vector     | Used between **Autonomous Systems** on the Internet. Supports **policy-based routing**.                             |
| **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** | Hybrid          | Cisco proprietary. Combines **distance-vector and link-state** features, considers multiple metrics.                |
| **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)** | Link-state      | Similar to OSPF, used mostly by large service providers, operates at **Layer 2 of OSI model**.                      |

### ‚úÖ Core Functions:

* **Route Discovery & Selection**
* **Route Maintenance & Updates**
* **Network Convergence**
* **Load Balancing & Failover Support**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The choice of routing protocol depends on **network size, convergence speed, policy support, and vendor compatibility**.
