## 📘 Boolean Algebra

**Boolean Algebra** is a branch of mathematics used to describe and simplify **digital circuits and logic gates**. Unlike conventional algebra, Boolean algebra deals with only **two values**:

* `1` (True / HIGH)
* `0` (False / LOW)

It is foundational to **digital electronics**, logic gate design, and computer architecture.

> 🧠 Invented by **George Boole** in 1854, it forms the basis of binary logic used in computing.

### 🧾 Basic Concepts

| Element         | Representation | Meaning                     |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Variables       | A, B, C, etc.  | Hold values 0 or 1          |
| NOT (Inversion) | A′ or ¬A or A̅ | Inverts value: 0 → 1, 1 → 0 |
| AND             | A · B or AB    | Returns 1 only if both = 1  |
| OR              | A + B          | Returns 1 if any input = 1  |

### 🔁 Boolean Laws

Boolean algebra follows specific algebraic **laws and rules** for simplifying expressions.

#### 1. **Commutative Law**

* **A + B = B + A** (for OR)
* **A · B = B · A** (for AND)

➡ The order of variables **doesn’t affect** the result.

#### 2. **Associative Law**

* **(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)**
* **(A · B) · C = A · (B · C)**

➡ Grouping of variables **doesn’t matter** in expressions.

#### 3. **Distributive Law**

* **A · (B + C) = A · B + A · C**

➡ Like in regular algebra, AND distributes over OR.

### ✅ Identity Laws

#### AND Laws

| Expression | Result | Meaning                    |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| A · 0      | 0      | Anything AND 0 is 0        |
| A · 1      | A      | Anything AND 1 is itself   |
| A · A      | A      | Redundant terms eliminated |

#### OR Laws

| Expression | Result | Meaning                    |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| A + 0      | A      | Anything OR 0 is itself    |
| A + 1      | 1      | Anything OR 1 is 1         |
| A + A      | A      | Redundant terms eliminated |

### 🔄 Inversion (NOT) Law

* **(A′)′ = A**

➡ Double inversion returns the original value.

### 🧠 Use of Boolean Algebra

* Simplifying logic circuits
* Designing minimal-cost digital hardware
* Analyzing truth tables and logic gate combinations
* Used in tools like **Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps)** and **Boolean simplifiers**

### 🔧 Example

**Expression:**
`Y = A + A · B`

**Simplified using Absorption Law:**
`Y = A`

(Since `A + A · B = A`)
