---

## üîç What is Multi-Source BFS?

**Multi-Source BFS** is an extension of the standard **Breadth-First Search** algorithm where the traversal begins **simultaneously from multiple source nodes**. It's used when we want to compute the **shortest distance from *any* of the given source nodes** to every other node in the graph.

In **unweighted graphs**, where each edge has the same weight (typically 1), Multi-Source BFS efficiently calculates the minimum number of steps from the nearest source node to all others.

## üéØ When to Use Multi-Source BFS

* You are given **multiple source nodes**
* You want to find the **minimum distance** from any source to each node
* The graph is **unweighted**
* Common in problems involving **multiple starting points** like:

  * Fire spreading from multiple buildings
  * Zombie infection from multiple people
  * Nearest hospital from many ambulances

---

## üß† Key Principle

> Instead of running BFS **multiple times** from each source (which costs `O(K*(V+E))`), you run a **single BFS**, initializing the queue with **all sources at once**, and perform a unified traversal.

---

## üßÆ Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

Let `sources` be the list of source nodes.

```python
from collections import deque

def multi_source_bfs(adj, sources, n):
    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    q = deque()

    # Initialize all source nodes
    for src in sources:
        dist[src] = 0
        visited[src] = True
        q.append(src)

    # Standard BFS loop
    while q:
        node = q.popleft()
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1
                q.append(neighbor)

    return dist
```

* `adj`: adjacency list of the graph
* `sources`: list of source node indices
* `dist[i]`: shortest distance from **any** source to node `i`

## üß™ Example

**Graph:**

```
0 - 1 - 2 - 3
    |
    4
```

**Source nodes:** `[0, 4]`

**Expected Output:**

```
dist = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
```

* Node `2` is closer to source `0`
* Node `4` is a source itself (distance 0)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Aspect    | Complexity |
| --------- | ---------- |
| **Time**  | `O(V + E)` |
| **Space** | `O(V)`     |

Where:

* `V` = number of vertices
* `E` = number of edges

‚û°Ô∏è It‚Äôs **faster** and more efficient than doing `K` individual BFS for `K` sources.

| Concept                                                                  | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| üß† **Always mark visited when pushing** into the queue, not when popping |             |
| üìä Works for **grids, matrices**, and **custom graphs**                  |             |
| üîÅ For **weighted graphs**, this won't work‚Äîuse **Dijkstra** instead     |             |
| üß© Often used in **shortest distance to nearest resource** problems      |             |

## üìå BFS vs Multi-Source BFS

| Feature        | BFS                    | Multi-Source BFS           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| # of Sources   | One                    | Multiple                   |
| Initialization | Single node            | All sources in queue       |
| Used For       | Shortest from 1 source | Shortest from *any* source |
| BFS Complexity | `O(V + E)`             | Same: `O(V + E)`           |

## üß† Real-World Applications

* **Grid puzzles** where some cells act as "starting points"
* **Shortest path from multiple hospitals**
* **Infectious spread from multiple people (zombies, fire, etc.)**
* **Routing and network propagation**

---

## üìù Summary

* Multi-Source BFS is a smart optimization to find the **minimum distance from multiple sources**
* Works best in **unweighted graphs**
* Time Complexity remains **O(V + E)** like regular BFS
* Common in **grid-based GATE problems** and **competitive programming**
