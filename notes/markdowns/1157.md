## **Using Expo CLI vs React Native CLI**

---

## **1. Concept**

React Native can be initialized and managed in two primary ways:

1. **Expo CLI** → A managed or bare workflow environment maintained by [Expo](https://expo.dev), which abstracts away native build configuration.
2. **React Native CLI** → The official community CLI for bare-metal control over native code and dependencies.

Both approaches produce React Native apps, but **Expo CLI prioritizes speed of setup and developer convenience**, while **React Native CLI provides full native control and flexibility**.

At Enterprise-scale, the choice impacts:

* **Build automation pipelines**
* **Team onboarding time**
* **Native feature velocity**
* **Maintenance overhead**
* **Cross-platform parity**

## **2. Architecture Differences**

| Feature                        | **Expo CLI**                                                                      | **React Native CLI**                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup Speed**                | Minutes — one command installs everything                                         | Slower — requires Node.js, Android/iOS SDKs, Xcode, JDK, Watchman |
| **Native Code Access**         | Limited in Managed workflow; full access in Bare workflow                         | Full native access from the start                                 |
| **OTA (Over-the-Air) Updates** | Built-in via `expo-updates`                                                       | Requires custom implementation (CodePush, AppCenter)              |
| **Prebuilt APIs**              | Many out-of-the-box modules (camera, push notifications, sensors) without linking | Must manually install & link native modules                       |
| **App Size**                   | Larger for managed apps due to bundled native APIs                                | Smaller, only includes used modules                               |
| **CI/CD Complexity**           | Lower — no native build servers needed (EAS Build optional)                       | Higher — requires macOS for iOS, Android tooling                  |
| **Upgrade Process**            | Expo SDK upgrade; can be constrained by SDK release cycles                        | Use `react-native upgrade`; fully aligned with RN releases        |
| **Custom Native Modules**      | Limited in Managed workflow; possible in Bare                                     | Fully supported                                                   |
| **Debugging & Profiling**      | Built-in dev menu, Expo Go app                                                    | Full access to Xcode/Android Studio profilers                     |

## **3. Detailed Setup**

### **A. Using Expo CLI**

Best for:

* Rapid prototyping
* Teams without native iOS/Android expertise
* Apps that fit within Expo’s supported APIs

#### **Install**

```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
```

#### **Create a project**

```bash
expo init MyApp
cd MyApp
expo start
```

You can scan the QR code in the terminal using **Expo Go** app (iOS/Android) to instantly preview without compiling native code.

#### **Build for production**

```bash
expo build:android
expo build:ios
```

Or use **EAS Build** for cloud compilation.

---

### **B. Using React Native CLI**

Best for:

* Enterprise-scale apps requiring deep native integration
* Heavy performance optimizations at native layer
* Third-party SDKs with native components

#### **Install**

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

#### **Create a project**

```bash
npx react-native init MyApp
cd MyApp
npx react-native run-android  # Android
npx react-native run-ios      # iOS (macOS only)
```

Here you have:

* **Full Xcode project** for iOS
* **Full Gradle project** for Android

You must manage:

* CocoaPods
* Android SDK versions
* Linking native modules manually

## **4. Enterprise-Level Decision Matrix**

| Criteria                  | Use Expo CLI if…                                        | Use React Native CLI if…                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Time to MVP**           | You need a working app in hours                         | You have weeks & full mobile dev team      |
| **Native SDK Access**     | You’re fine with Expo’s API set                         | You need low-level APIs / custom C++       |
| **Build Infrastructure**  | You lack macOS/iOS build machines                       | You have full mobile CI/CD setup           |
| **OTA Updates**           | You want instant updates without app store resubmission | You have custom OTA setup (e.g., CodePush) |
| **App Size Optimization** | Less critical                                           | Highly critical                            |
| **Long-term Maintenance** | Small-medium team, fast iteration                       | Large team, long-lived codebase            |

---

## **5. ==Hybrid Approach at Enterprise Scale==**

Many large-scale teams:

* Start with **Expo Managed Workflow** for rapid prototyping & UX validation.
* Eject to **Expo Bare Workflow** (essentially React Native CLI + Expo APIs) when native customization is needed.
* Gradually replace or strip Expo modules to reduce app size.

## **6. Enterprise-Level Best Practices**

1. **Monorepo Integration**: Use Yarn Workspaces/TurboRepo to integrate RN apps into larger ecosystems.
2. **EAS Build Caching**: For Expo CLI, enable build caching to speed CI builds.
3. **Hermes Engine**: Enable Hermes for reduced memory usage & faster startup.
4. **Custom Dev Containers**: Use Docker for reproducible RN CLI environments.
5. **Automated Onboarding Scripts**: One-command setup for both Expo & RN CLI workflows.
6. **Upgrade Strategy**: Align RN/Expo upgrades with dependency audits & regression testing.
