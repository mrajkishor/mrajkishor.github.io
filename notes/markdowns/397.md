# 🔁 Amazon SQS – FIFO Queue: Guaranteed Order with Exactly-Once Delivery

In distributed systems, message queues help decouple services and handle workloads asynchronously. But what if **order matters**? What if a message sent second **must not** be processed before the first? That’s where **Amazon SQS FIFO Queue** comes in — ensuring strict order and eliminating duplicates.

Let’s dive deep into how FIFO queues solve critical sequencing and delivery problems.

## 🧾 What is a FIFO Queue?

FIFO stands for **First In, First Out** — meaning messages are **processed in the exact order** in which they are sent. Unlike standard SQS queues that offer best-effort ordering, FIFO queues **guarantee the sequence** of delivery.

## 🧩 Key Features

### 1. **Strict Message Ordering**
Messages sent by the producer are processed in the **exact same order** by the consumer.

- Example:
  ```
  Sent Order   →  4 → 3 → 2 → 1
  Received Order →  4 → 3 → 2 → 1
  ```

### 2. **Exactly-Once Processing**
Using a **Deduplication ID**, FIFO queues ensure that the same message is **never sent twice**, avoiding duplicate processing even if retries happen.

### 3. **Message Grouping**
Messages with the **same Message Group ID** are processed in order. Messages with **different Group IDs** can be processed in **parallel**, improving throughput while maintaining ordering **within each group**.

## ⚙️ Throughput Limits

| Mode              | Maximum Throughput        |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Without Batching  | 300 messages per second    |
| With Batching     | 3,000 messages per second  |

This makes FIFO queues ideal for **use cases that require ordering** but **not high throughput**, such as:

- Financial transactions
- Inventory updates
- Logging systems
- Workflow pipelines

## 📦 Real-World Use Case

Imagine a payment gateway that must process **Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3** in exact sequence:

```bash
1. Authenticate user
2. Deduct amount
3. Send confirmation
```

Using a standard queue might result in “Step 3” being processed before “Step 1.” But with **FIFO**, you’re safe.

## 🧪 Hands-On Example (CLI)

### Create FIFO Queue
```bash
aws sqs create-queue \
  --queue-name order-processing.fifo \
  --attributes FifoQueue=true,ContentBasedDeduplication=true
```

### Send Message
```bash
aws sqs send-message \
  --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/order-processing.fifo \
  --message-body "Order ID 1001" \
  --message-group-id "customer-001" \
  --message-deduplication-id "msg-001"
```

### Receive Message
```bash
aws sqs receive-message \
  --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/order-processing.fifo
```

## 📝 Summary

| Feature                    | FIFO Queue                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Ordering                   | ✅ Guaranteed                        |
| Duplicate Messages         | ❌ Prevented with Deduplication ID   |
| Parallelism                | ✅ With different Message Group IDs |
| Throughput                 | ⚠️ Limited                          |
| Use Case Fit               | High-order-sensitive systems         |

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

While standard SQS queues are perfect for **high-throughput** systems, **FIFO queues** shine when **order and consistency** matter more than speed. They're ideal for **transactional systems**, **sequential workflows**, and **event sourcing** patterns.

> Note:  ==Event sourcing== is a design pattern where changes to a system's state are stored as a sequence of immutable events, allowing for reconstruction of the state at any point in time and providing a rich audit trail

> With SQS FIFO, your messages are not just delivered — they’re delivered **exactly right**.
