# 🚀 Instantiating Scalable Web Apps on AWS – Deep Dive

Building a reliable and scalable web application like **MyWordPress.com** on AWS involves smart choices about compute, storage, and databases. Let’s break down the key concepts and patterns covered in the lecture:

---

## 🧱 1. Building a Stateful WordPress App

The goal is to create a **fully scalable WordPress website** that:

* Displays uploaded images reliably,
* Stores all blog/user data in a **MySQL database**, and
* Scales across multiple availability zones (AZs).

---

## 💾 2. Database Layer – Scaling with Aurora (Multi-AZ + Read Replicas)

Traditional MySQL setups can bottleneck under load. Instead, use:

* **Amazon Aurora MySQL**

  * Highly available with **Multi-AZ** deployments.
  * Supports **Read Replicas** to distribute read-heavy workloads.
  * Designed for WordPress workloads that require fast reads & reliable writes.

**💡 Why it matters:** Aurora handles replication, backups, and failover automatically—making your WordPress site resilient at scale.

## 🖼️ 3. Storing Images – EBS vs EFS

### Option A: **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

* Attached to a single EC2 instance (think local disk).
* Great for **single-instance** setups.
* Problem? **Not shareable** across instances—bad for high-availability or autoscaling.

### Option B: **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**

* A **shared network file system**, mountable across **multiple EC2s** in different AZs.
* Perfect for **distributed architectures**.
* Use **ENI (Elastic Network Interfaces)** to connect EC2 to EFS.

**✅ Use EBS if you're running a single app node.**
**✅ Use EFS when you scale horizontally across instances.**

## ⚡ 4. Speeding Up Launch Time – EC2, RDS, EBS Snapshots

Bootstrapping a full stack (EC2 + EBS + RDS) can take time. To **speed up deployments**:

### 🔸 EC2:

* **Golden AMIs**: Pre-installed images with OS, app, and dependencies.
* **User Data**: Shell scripts for on-the-fly setup.
* **Hybrid**: Combine both (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk style).

### 🔸 RDS:

* Use **snapshots** to restore schema & data.

### 🔸 EBS:

* Restore volumes from snapshots (pre-formatted with data).

## 🏗️ 5. 3-Tier Web App Architecture (Best Practice)

Typical architecture pattern:

1. **Public Subnet**:

   * **Route 53** (DNS) → directs users.
   * **ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)** → distributes traffic.

2. **Private Subnet**:

   * **Auto Scaling Group** of EC2 instances (App Servers).
   * M5 instances handling PHP + WordPress logic.

3. **Data Subnet**:

   * **Amazon RDS** → Stores WordPress data (users, posts).
   * **ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached)** → Stores session/cached data for faster access.

---

## 🧑‍💻 6. Developer Pain Points on AWS

Common challenges:

* Infra management: EC2, RDS, ELB, networking.
* CI/CD: Code deployment pipelines.
* Configuring database connections, volumes, backups.
* Scaling reliably without downtime.

🛠️ **Reality:** Most developers just want their code to run.
🔁 **Pattern:** Most apps follow the same template — ALB + ASG + RDS + ElastiCache.
☁️ **Solution:** Abstract infra and focus on repeatable patterns.

---

## 🔚 Summary

* Use **Aurora MySQL** with **Multi-AZ + Read Replicas** for DB scalability.
* Prefer **EFS** over **EBS** for shared storage in autoscaling environments.
* Use **snapshots, Golden AMIs, and User Data** for faster stack instantiation.
* Follow a **3-tier architecture**: Public (ELB), Private (App), Data (RDS/Cache).
* Cloud-native thinking = less infra friction, more code shipping.
