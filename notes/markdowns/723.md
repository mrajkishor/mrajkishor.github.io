## 📘 **React / Event Handling / Understanding Synthetic Events**

---

### ✅ What are Synthetic Events in React?

In React, **Synthetic Events** are **cross-browser wrappers** around the browser’s native events. They **normalize the event system** so that React applications behave consistently across all browsers.

React creates these synthetic events from the browser’s native events using a wrapper called `SyntheticEvent`, which mimics all the properties and methods of native events.

---

### 🧠 Why React Uses Synthetic Events?

1. **Cross-browser Compatibility**
   Ensures consistent behavior across different browsers by abstracting away inconsistencies in native event APIs.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   React uses an event delegation system — it attaches a **single event listener** to the root of the DOM (not every node), which improves performance and memory usage.

3. **Pooling and Reuse**
   For performance, React pools synthetic event objects (i.e., reuses them). After the event handler executes, the event object’s properties are nulled out.

---

### 📦 How Synthetic Events Work

React internally sets up a listener on the root DOM (`document`) and captures all events like `click`, `change`, `submit`, etc. When an event occurs:

* React creates a `SyntheticEvent` object.
* The synthetic event is passed to the corresponding React handler (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`).
* The synthetic event object wraps the native DOM event and standardizes its properties.

### 🔁 Event Pooling in React (before v17)

To optimize performance, React versions before v17 used **event pooling** — the `SyntheticEvent` object is reused for multiple events.

#### 🚫 Common Pitfall (pre-v17):

```js
function handleClick(event) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(event.type); // ❌ Will throw error: null
  }, 0);
}
```

#### ✅ Fix:

```js
function handleClick(event) {
  event.persist(); // Prevents React from pooling this event
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(event.type); // ✅ Works
  }, 0);
}
```

> ⚠️ Note: From **React 17 onwards**, event pooling is disabled — you don't need to call `event.persist()`.

---

### 🧬 SyntheticEvent API

The `SyntheticEvent` interface has the following properties:

* `bubbles`
* `cancelable`
* `currentTarget`
* `defaultPrevented`
* `eventPhase`
* `isTrusted`
* `nativeEvent`
* `target`
* `type`
* `timeStamp`

Common methods:

* `preventDefault()`
* `stopPropagation()`
* `persist()`

---

### 🧪 Example Usage

```jsx
function Button() {
  const handleClick = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();           // Prevents default browser behavior
    e.stopPropagation();          // Stops the event from bubbling
    console.log(e.nativeEvent);   // Access underlying native DOM event
    console.log(e.type);          // "click"
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

### 🔄 Difference: Synthetic vs Native Event

| Feature                    | SyntheticEvent         | Native DOM Event |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Available in React         | Yes                    | Yes              |
| Consistent across browsers | ✅ Yes                  | ❌ No             |
| Pooled                     | ✅ (pre-v17)            | ❌ No pooling     |
| Memory efficient           | ✅                      | ❌                |
| `e.nativeEvent`            | Refers to native event | N/A              |

---

### 📌 Summary

* Synthetic events unify browser event inconsistencies.
* They are wrappers over native events with the same interface.
* Event pooling existed in React <17, removed in React 17+.
* Use `e.nativeEvent` to access the original DOM event if needed.
* React’s event delegation improves performance and scalability.
