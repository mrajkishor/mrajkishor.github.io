### **Understanding Data Definition Language (DDL) in SQL**

**Data Definition Language (DDL)** is a subset of SQL commands used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, schemas, indexes, and views. DDL commands deal with the **schema** of the database, meaning they control the way data is stored, organized, and represented.

In this blog, weâ€™ll cover key DDL commands with detailed explanations and examples.

### **Key DDL Commands**
1. **CREATE**: Creates database objects like tables, views, or databases.
2. **ALTER**: Modifies existing database objects.
3. **DROP**: Deletes database objects.
4. **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table while keeping the structure intact.
5. **COMMENT**: Adds a description to database objects.
6. **RENAME**: Renames a database object.

### **1. CREATE Command**
The `CREATE` command is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, or views.

#### **Example: Create a Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    JoiningDate DATE
);
```

This creates a table named `Employees` with columns for employee details.

#### **Example: Create a Database**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;
```

This creates a new database named `CompanyDB`.

#### **Example: Create a View**
```sql
CREATE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS
SELECT Name, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 100000;
```

This creates a view showing employees earning more than 100,000.

### **2. ALTER Command**
The `ALTER` command modifies the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or removing columns from a table.

#### **Example: Add a Column**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Address VARCHAR(100);
```
Adds a new column `Address` to the `Employees` table.

#### **Example: Modify a Column**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees MODIFY Salary DECIMAL(12, 2);
```
Modifies the `Salary` column to increase its precision.

#### **Example: Drop a Column**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees DROP COLUMN Address;
```
Removes the `Address` column from the `Employees` table.

---

### **3. DROP Command**
The `DROP` command deletes database objects permanently.

#### **Example: Drop a Table**
```sql
DROP TABLE Employees;
```
Deletes the `Employees` table along with its data.

#### **Example: Drop a Database**
```sql
DROP DATABASE CompanyDB;
```
Deletes the `CompanyDB` database entirely.

#### **Example: Drop a View**
```sql
DROP VIEW HighSalaryEmployees;
```
Removes the `HighSalaryEmployees` view.

---

### **4. TRUNCATE Command**
The `TRUNCATE` command removes all rows from a table but retains its structure. It is faster than `DELETE` because it does not log individual row deletions.

#### **Example: Truncate a Table**
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
```
Deletes all rows from the `Employees` table while keeping the table intact for future use.

---

### **5. COMMENT Command**
The `COMMENT` command adds descriptive text to database objects for documentation purposes.

#### **Example: Add a Comment to a Table**
```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE Employees IS 'This table stores employee details.';
```

#### **Example: Add a Comment to a Column**
```sql
COMMENT ON COLUMN Employees.Salary IS 'Salary in USD';
```

---

### **6. RENAME Command**
The `RENAME` command changes the name of a database object.

#### **Example: Rename a Table**
```sql
RENAME Employees TO Staff;
```
Renames the `Employees` table to `Staff`.

### **DDL Commands in Practice**

#### Scenario: Managing a Company Database
1. **Create a Database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;
   ```
2. **Switch to the Database**:
   ```sql
   USE CompanyDB;
   ```
3. **Create a Table for Employees**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Name VARCHAR(50),
       Department VARCHAR(50),
       Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
   );
   ```
4. **Add a New Column**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Employees ADD JoiningDate DATE;
   ```
5. **Delete All Data Without Dropping the Table**:
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
   ```
6. **Drop the Table**:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE Employees;
   ```

### **Key Differences Between DDL and Other SQL Commands**

| Feature                 | DDL                         | DML                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | Defines database structure  | Manipulates data            |
| **Key Commands**        | CREATE, ALTER, DROP         | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE      |
| **Impact**              | Affects schema              | Affects data                |
| **Transaction Control** | Implicitly committed        | Requires explicit commit    |

### **Conclusion**
DDL commands are essential for defining and managing the structure of a database. By mastering DDL commands such as `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `COMMENT`, and `RENAME`, you can effectively design and maintain a robust database schema. These commands form the foundation for any database application, making them a critical skill for developers and database administrators alike.
