## 🧠 What is Amazon SNS?

**Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)** is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that lets you:
- Push one message to **many subscribers**
- Decouple microservices and backend systems
- Send alerts, notifications, and events across distributed components

Common Use Cases:
- Alerting systems (email, SMS)
- Event-driven architecture (e.g., Order placed → Notify services)
- Serverless communication (SNS → Lambda)

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

You’ll need:
- An AWS account
- IAM user with access to SNS, SQS, Lambda
- AWS CLI or AWS Console
- Optional: AWS SDK (for programmatic publishing)

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step: SNS Hands-On

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Create an SNS Topic

1. Go to **Amazon SNS Console**
2. Click **“Create topic”**
3. Choose:
   - Type: **Standard** (FIFO is optional for strict ordering)
   - Name: `OrderUpdates`
4. Click **Create topic**

🎉 Done! You now have a topic where you can publish messages.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Subscribe to the Topic

You can add subscribers like:
- **Email**
- **SQS Queue**
- **Lambda function**
- **HTTP(S) endpoints**

#### ✅ Example 1: Subscribe an Email
1. On the topic page, click **“Create subscription”**
2. Protocol: **Email**
3. Endpoint: `your-email@example.com`
4. Click **Create subscription**
5. Go to your email and **confirm the subscription**

> 🧪 Test: You’ll only receive messages after confirming.

---

#### ✅ Example 2: Subscribe an SQS Queue

1. Create an SQS queue (let’s call it `OrderQueue`)
2. Go to SNS Topic → **Create subscription**
3. Protocol: **Amazon SQS**
4. Select `OrderQueue` from the dropdown
5. Make sure the **SQS Access Policy** allows SNS to write:
   ```json
   {
     "Sid": "Allow-SNS-SendMessage",
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Principal": "*",
     "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
     "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:OrderQueue",
     "Condition": {
       "ArnEquals": {
         "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:sns:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:OrderUpdates"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

---

#### ✅ Example 3: Trigger a Lambda Function

1. Create a Lambda function
2. Grant SNS invoke permissions via Lambda console or CLI
3. Subscribe Lambda to the topic
4. SNS will invoke your function with the message as input

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Publish a Message

Now go back to your **OrderUpdates** topic and:

1. Click **“Publish message”**
2. Subject: `Order Placed`
3. Message body:  
   ```json
   {
     "orderId": 1001,
     "status": "Placed"
   }
   ```
4. Click **Publish message**

🎯 Result:
- Your email receives the notification.
- The SQS queue stores the message.
- Lambda (if subscribed) is triggered automatically.

---

## 🔁 Real-World Pattern: Fan-Out with SQS

Want to notify multiple systems like fraud detection, shipping, and invoicing?

Use this architecture:

```
Buying Service
     |
     v
  SNS Topic
  /    |    \
SQS1 SQS2  SQS3
 |     |     |
Lambda Lambda Lambda
```

Each SQS can trigger a different Lambda or service. This is the **fan-out** pattern.

---

## 🎯 Advanced: Message Filtering

Instead of all subscribers receiving all messages, apply **filter policies**.

### Example:
Filter only orders with `status: Cancelled`
```json
{
  "status": ["Cancelled"]
}
```

Apply this JSON filter when subscribing.

---

## 🔃 Bonus: FIFO Topics

If **message order** and **deduplication** matter, use **SNS FIFO Topics**:
- Messages ordered using `MessageGroupId`
- Use `DeduplicationId` to avoid duplicate delivery

Combine with **SQS FIFO Queues** to maintain strict delivery rules.

---

## 🧹 Clean Up

To avoid charges:
- Delete SNS topic
- Delete SQS queues
- Delete Lambda functions
- Unsubscribe email

| Feature             | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| SNS Topic           | Publishes messages to subscribers                |
| SQS / Email / Lambda| Subscribers to receive and process messages      |
| Fan-out             | One-to-many delivery architecture                |
| Filtering           | Route messages conditionally                     |
| FIFO Topic          | Ordered and deduplicated messaging               |
